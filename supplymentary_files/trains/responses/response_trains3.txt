To find the complex class expression, we need to identify the properties and characteristics that apply to the positive examples (kb:east1, kb:east2, kb:east3) but not to the negative examples (kb:east4, kb:east5).

Let's analyze the given knowledge base:

**Positive Examples:**
- **kb:east1** hasCar: car_14, car_13, car_12, car_11
- **kb:east2** hasCar: car_23, car_22, car_21
- **kb:east3** hasCar: car_33, car_32, car_31

**Negative Examples:**
- **kb:east4** hasCar: car_44, car_43, car_42, car_41
- **kb:east5** hasCar: car_53, car_52, car_51

**Analysis:**
1. **Positive Example Cars:**
   - car_14, car_13, car_12, car_11, car_23, car_22, car_21, car_33, car_32, car_31
   - Common properties:
     - Many have the shape "rectangle" (car_13, car_12, car_11, car_23, car_22, car_33, car_32, car_31).
     - Many have "loadCount" of "one" (car_13, car_12, car_21, car_33, car_32, car_31).
     - Many have "wheels" with "two" (car_12, car_22, car_21, car_32, car_31).

2. **Negative Example Cars:**
   - car_44, car_43, car_42, car_41, car_53, car_52, car_51
   - Common properties:
     - Many have the shape "rectangle" (car_44, car_42, car_52, car_51).
     - Many have "loadCount" of "one" (car_44, car_43, car_52, car_51).
     - Many have "wheels" with "two" (car_42, car_43, car_51).

**Distinctive Features:**
- The positive examples have cars with "wheels" of "two" and "loadCount" of "one" that are not present in the negative examples.

**Complex Class Expression:**
The complex class expression that applies to the positive examples but not the negative examples is:

\[ \text{hasCar some (Car and (wheels value two) and (loadCount value one))} \]
