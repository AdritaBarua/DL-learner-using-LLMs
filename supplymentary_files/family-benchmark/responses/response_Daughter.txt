To determine the complex class expression for "Daughter" based on the given positive and negative examples, we need to analyze the relationships and class memberships in the ontology.

### Analysis:

1. **Class Membership:**
   - All positive examples are instances of the class `Female`.
   - Negative examples include instances of both `Male` and `Female`.

2. **Relationships:**
   - Positive examples often have relationships indicating they are children of other individuals (e.g., `hasParent`).
   - Negative examples include individuals with `hasChild` relationships, indicating they are parents, not children.

3. **Sibling Relationships:**
   - Positive examples may have `hasSibling` relationships, but this is not exclusive to them.

4. **Marital Status:**
   - Positive examples do not have `married` relationships, which is more common in negative examples.

### Complex Class Expression:

Given the analysis, the complex class expression for "Daughter" can be constructed as follows:

- **Female:** The individual must be an instance of the class `Female`.
- **Has Parent:** The individual should have a `hasParent` relationship, indicating they are a child.
- **Not Married:** The individual should not have a `married` relationship, as daughters in this context are likely unmarried.

Thus, the complex class expression for "Daughter" is:

```plaintext
Female and (hasParent some Thing) and not (married some Thing)
```

This expression captures the essence of being a daughter: a female who is a child of someone and is not married.
