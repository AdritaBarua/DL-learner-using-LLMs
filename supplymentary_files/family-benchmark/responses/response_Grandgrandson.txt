To determine the complex class expression for "Grandgrandson" based on the given positive and negative examples, we need to analyze the relationships and properties that are common among the positive examples but not present in the negative examples. The goal is to identify a pattern or set of conditions that uniquely apply to the positive examples.

### Analysis:

1. **Positive Examples:**
   - All instances are male (e.g., `ex:F2M18`, `ex:F2M25`, etc.).
   - Many have a `hasParent` relationship with another male or female instance.
   - Some have a `hasChild` relationship, indicating they are parents themselves.
   - Some have a `hasSibling` relationship, indicating they have siblings.

2. **Negative Examples:**
   - Include both male and female instances.
   - Some have a `married` relationship, which is not a focus for grandgrandsons.
   - Some are parents but not necessarily grandgrandsons.

### Common Patterns in Positive Examples:
- **Male:** All positive examples are male.
- **Has Parent:** Many positive examples have a `hasParent` relationship, indicating they are children.
- **Has Grandparent:** To be a "grandgrandson," an instance should have a grandparent, which implies a `hasParent` relationship with a parent who also has a `hasParent` relationship.

### Complex Class Expression:
Based on the analysis, the complex class expression for "Grandgrandson" can be constructed as follows:

```plaintext
Male and (hasParent some (hasParent some Person))
```

### Explanation:
- **Male:** The individual must be male.
- **hasParent some (hasParent some Person):** The individual must have a parent who also has a parent, indicating the presence of a grandparent, which is a key characteristic of being a "grandgrandson."

This expression captures the essence of being a "grandgrandson" by ensuring the individual is male and has a lineage that includes a grandparent.
