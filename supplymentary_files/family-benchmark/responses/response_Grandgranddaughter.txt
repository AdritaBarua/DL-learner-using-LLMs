To determine a complex class expression for "Grandgranddaughter" based on the given positive and negative examples, we need to analyze the relationships and properties that are common among the positive examples but not present in the negative examples. 

### Analysis:

1. **Positive Examples:**
   - **ex:F2F17, ex:F2F33, ex:F3F49, ex:F3F52, ex:F6F83, ex:F6F89, ex:F6F96, ex:F6F97, ex:F7F108, ex:F7F118, ex:F7F129, ex:F7F127, ex:F9F145, ex:F9F148, ex:F9F150, ex:F9F164, ex:F10F201**
   - These instances are all females (as indicated by the "F" in their identifiers).
   - They have relationships indicating they are descendants, such as "hasParent" and "hasChild".

2. **Negative Examples:**
   - **ex:F2F28, ex:F3F41, ex:F6F70, ex:F10F179, ex:F3M50, ex:F6F74, ex:F7F114, ex:F8M138, ex:F6M88, ex:F10M194, ex:F5M60, ex:F2F19, ex:F1F3, ex:F8F137, ex:F9M142, ex:F3M47, ex:F2F10**
   - These instances include both males and females.
   - They may not have the same descendant relationships or may not be as far down the lineage.

### Common Characteristics of Positive Examples:
- They are all instances of the class "Female".
- They have a "hasParent" relationship, indicating they are children.
- They are likely to have a "hasChild" relationship, indicating they are also parents, which is a characteristic of being a grandchild.
- They are not directly married or have a "married" relationship, which might be more common in the negative examples.

### Complex Class Expression:
Based on the analysis, a potential complex class expression for "Grandgranddaughter" could be:

```plaintext
Female and (hasParent some (hasParent some Thing))
```

This expression indicates that the individual is a female who has a parent, and that parent also has a parent, which aligns with the concept of being a grandchild. This expression captures the essence of being a "Grandgranddaughter" by focusing on the lineage and gender.
