To determine the complex class expression for "Mother" based on the given positive and negative examples, we need to analyze the relationships and properties that are common among the positive examples but not present in the negative examples. The goal is to identify a pattern or set of conditions that uniquely apply to the positive examples.

### Analysis:

1. **Class Membership**:
   - All positive examples are instances of the class `Female`.
   - Negative examples include instances of both `Male` and `Female`.

2. **Relationships**:
   - Positive examples often have relationships indicating they have children (`hasChild`).
   - Negative examples may have `hasChild` relationships but are not consistently `Female`.

3. **Parent-Child Relationship**:
   - Positive examples frequently have `hasChild` relationships, suggesting they are parents.
   - Negative examples may have `hasChild` relationships but are not consistently `Female`.

4. **Sibling and Marriage Relationships**:
   - Positive examples may have `hasSibling` or `married` relationships, but these are not unique to mothers.

### Complex Class Expression:

Given the analysis, the complex class expression for "Mother" can be constructed as follows:

- **Female**: The individual must be an instance of the class `Female`.
- **Has Child**: The individual must have at least one `hasChild` relationship.

Thus, the complex class expression for "Mother" is:

```plaintext
Female and (hasChild some Thing)
```

This expression captures the essence of a "Mother" as being a female who has at least one child, which aligns with the characteristics of the positive examples and distinguishes them from the negative examples.
