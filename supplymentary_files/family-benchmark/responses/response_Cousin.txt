To determine a complex class expression for "Cousin" based on the given positive and negative examples, we need to identify the common characteristics and relationships that apply to the positive examples but not to the negative examples. This involves analyzing the relationships and class memberships of the individuals in both sets.

### Analysis:

1. **Positive Examples:**
   - The positive examples include a mix of males and females.
   - Many of the positive examples have relationships such as `hasSibling`, `hasParent`, `married`, and `hasChild`.
   - The positive examples are often related through sibling or parental relationships, but not directly as siblings or direct descendants.

2. **Negative Examples:**
   - The negative examples also include a mix of males and females.
   - Many negative examples are directly related as siblings, parents, or children.
   - Some negative examples are married, indicating a direct family relationship.

### Common Characteristics in Positive Examples:
- The positive examples often have indirect family relationships, such as being children of siblings (i.e., first cousins).
- They are not direct siblings or direct descendants of each other.
- They may share a common ancestor but are not directly related as parent-child or siblings.

### Complex Class Expression for "Cousin":
Based on the analysis, a possible complex class expression for "Cousin" could be:

```plaintext
Person and (hasParent some (hasSibling some Person)) and not (hasSibling some Person) and not (hasChild some Person)
```

### Explanation:
- **`Person`:** The individual is a person.
- **`hasParent some (hasSibling some Person)`:** The individual has a parent who has a sibling (i.e., the individual's aunt or uncle).
- **`not (hasSibling some Person)`:** The individual is not a direct sibling of another person.
- **`not (hasChild some Person)`:** The individual does not have a direct child, ensuring they are not a direct ancestor.

This expression captures the idea of a cousin as someone who is related through a parent's sibling but is not a direct sibling or parent themselves.
