To determine the complex class expression that distinguishes the positive examples from the negative examples, we need to analyze the relationships and properties that are common among the positive examples but not present in the negative examples. 

Let's break down the characteristics of the positive examples:

1. **Gender**: All positive examples are instances of the class 'Female'.
2. **Relationships**:
   - Many of the positive examples have relationships like `hasSibling`, `hasParent`, or `hasChild`.
   - Some positive examples are involved in `married` relationships, but this is not exclusive to them.

3. **Common Patterns**:
   - The positive examples often have `hasSibling` relationships.
   - They are involved in `hasChild` or `hasParent` relationships, but these are also present in some negative examples.

4. **Exclusion of Negative Examples**:
   - The negative examples include both males and females, but the positive examples are exclusively female.
   - Some negative examples have `hasSibling` relationships, but they are not exclusively female.

Given these observations, the complex class expression that captures the essence of the positive examples while excluding the negative examples is:

**Female and (hasSibling some Thing)**

This expression indicates that the individual is female and has at least one sibling, which aligns with the characteristics of the positive examples and excludes the negative examples that do not fit this pattern.
