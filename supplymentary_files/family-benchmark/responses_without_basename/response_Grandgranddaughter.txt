To determine the complex class expression that distinguishes the positive examples from the negative examples, we need to analyze the relationships and properties that are common among the positive examples but not present in the negative examples. Let's break down the characteristics of the positive examples:

1. **Class Membership**: All positive examples are instances of the class 'Female'.
2. **Relationships**:
   - Many of the positive examples have a 'hasSibling' relationship.
   - Some have a 'hasParent' relationship.
   - Some have a 'hasChild' relationship.

3. **Common Patterns**:
   - The positive examples often have relationships with other instances that are also part of the 'Female' class.
   - The 'hasSibling' relationship is particularly common among the positive examples.

Given these observations, a complex class expression that captures these characteristics could be:

```plaintext
Female and (hasSibling some Female)
```

This expression indicates that the instances are of the class 'Female' and have a sibling who is also of the class 'Female'. This expression should cover the positive examples while excluding the negative examples, as the negative examples either do not have the 'hasSibling' relationship or are not part of the 'Female' class.
