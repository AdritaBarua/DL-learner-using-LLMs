To determine the complex class expression that distinguishes the positive examples from the negative examples, we need to analyze the characteristics and relationships of the instances in both sets. The goal is to find a pattern or set of conditions that apply to all positive examples but not to any negative examples.

### Analysis:

1. **Class Membership:**
   - All positive examples are instances of the class `Female`.
   - The negative examples include instances of both `Male` and `Female`.

2. **Relationships:**
   - Many positive examples have relationships indicating they are married or have children, but these relationships are not exclusive to the positive examples.
   - The positive examples include instances with relationships like `hasChild`, `married`, and `hasSibling`, but these are also present in the negative examples.

3. **Common Patterns:**
   - The positive examples are all instances of `Female`, which is a subclass of `Person`.
   - The negative examples include instances of `Male`, which is also a subclass of `Person`.

### Complex Class Expression:

Given the analysis, the distinguishing feature of the positive examples is that they are all instances of the class `Female`. Therefore, the complex class expression that applies to the positive examples but not to the negative examples is:

```plaintext
Female
```

This expression captures the fact that all positive examples are instances of the `Female` class, while the negative examples include instances of both `Male` and `Female`.
