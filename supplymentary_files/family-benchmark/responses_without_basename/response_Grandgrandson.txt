To determine the complex class expression that distinguishes the positive examples from the negative examples, we need to analyze the relationships and properties that are common among the positive examples but not present in the negative examples. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the analysis:

1. **Identify Common Properties and Relationships:**
   - The positive examples include instances like `ex:F2M18`, `ex:F2M25`, `ex:F2M23`, `ex:F2M32`, `ex:F2M35`, `ex:F3M51`, `ex:F3M47`, `ex:F5M68`, `ex:F6M75`, `ex:F6M99`, `ex:F7M112`, `ex:F7M110`, `ex:F7M113`, `ex:F7M117`, `ex:F7M125`, `ex:F7M123`, `ex:F7M131`, `ex:F8M138`, `ex:F9M147`, `ex:F9M155`, `ex:F9M161`, `ex:F9M166`, `ex:F10M190`, and `ex:F10M199`.
   - These instances are all males (`Male` class) and have various relationships such as `hasParent`, `hasChild`, `hasSibling`, and `married`.

2. **Analyze Relationships:**
   - Many of the positive examples have the `hasChild` relationship, indicating they are parents.
   - Some have the `hasSibling` relationship, indicating they have siblings.
   - The `hasParent` relationship is also common, indicating they are children of other instances.

3. **Exclude Negative Examples:**
   - The negative examples include instances like `ex:F3M45`, `ex:F6M85`, `ex:F10F192`, `ex:F6F70`, `ex:F7M115`, `ex:F10M197`, `ex:F5F65`, `ex:F2F17`, `ex:F9M170`, `ex:F9M144`, `ex:F3F53`, `ex:F2F36`, `ex:F6M92`, `ex:F3M43`, `ex:F8M134`, `ex:F9F141`, `ex:F9M142`, `ex:F9F148`, `ex:F10M184`, `ex:F10F198`, `ex:F3F49`, `ex:F8M132`, `ex:F2F30`, and `ex:F10F193`.
   - These instances may not have the same combination of relationships or may belong to different classes (e.g., `Female`).

4. **Formulate the Complex Class Expression:**
   - Based on the analysis, a distinguishing feature of the positive examples is that they are males who have children (`hasChild` relationship).
   - Therefore, the complex class expression that captures the commonality among the positive examples and excludes the negative examples is:

   ```
   Male and (hasChild some Thing)
   ```

This expression indicates that the instances are male and have at least one child, which is a common trait among the positive examples but not the negative ones.
