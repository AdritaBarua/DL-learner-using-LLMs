To determine the complex class expression that distinguishes the positive examples from the negative examples, we need to analyze the relationships and properties that are common among the positive examples but not present in the negative examples. 

### Analysis:

1. **Class Membership**: All positive examples are instances of the class `Male`, which is a subclass of `Person`. This is a common feature among all positive examples.

2. **Relationships**:
   - Many of the positive examples have relationships indicating they are married or have children, but these relationships are not unique to the positive examples.
   - A significant number of positive examples have the `hasChild` relationship, which is less common among the negative examples.

3. **Sibling Relationships**:
   - The positive examples do not have a consistent pattern of sibling relationships that distinguishes them from the negative examples.

4. **Parent Relationships**:
   - The positive examples often have `hasParent` relationships, but this is also not unique to them.

5. **Marital Status**:
   - Many positive examples are involved in `married` relationships, but this is not exclusive to them.

### Conclusion:

Given the analysis, the most distinguishing feature of the positive examples is their membership in the `Male` class and their involvement in `hasChild` relationships. Therefore, the complex class expression that captures the commonalities among the positive examples while excluding the negative examples is:

**Complex Class Expression**:  
```  
Male and (hasChild some Thing)
```

This expression indicates that the individuals are male and have at least one child, which aligns with the characteristics observed in the positive examples.
