To determine the complex class expression that distinguishes the positive examples from the negative examples, we need to analyze the relationships and properties that are common among the positive examples but not present in the negative examples. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the analysis:

1. **Identify Common Characteristics in Positive Examples:**
   - All positive examples are instances of the class `Male`.
   - Many of the positive examples have relationships indicating they are married or have children, but these relationships are not unique to the positive examples.
   - Some positive examples have relationships indicating they have siblings, but again, this is not unique to the positive examples.

2. **Identify Common Characteristics in Negative Examples:**
   - The negative examples include both males and females.
   - Some negative examples have relationships indicating they are married or have children, similar to the positive examples.
   - The negative examples do not consistently have a specific relationship or property that is absent in the positive examples.

3. **Determine Distinguishing Features:**
   - The key distinguishing feature is that all positive examples are instances of the class `Male`.
   - The negative examples include instances that are not `Male`.

4. **Formulate the Complex Class Expression:**
   - Since the primary distinguishing feature is the class `Male`, the complex class expression that applies to the positive examples but not the negative examples is simply:
   
   ```plaintext
   Male
   ```

This expression captures the essence of the positive examples being instances of the `Male` class, which is not consistently true for the negative examples.
