One very plausible answer is that all the positive examples are those persons who have at least one sibling, whereas many of the negatives do not. In other words, when you look at the positive examples (F1F5, F1F7, F2M13, F2F17, … F10F195) you will notice that each one is part of a “sibling‐group” (for example, F1F5 is stated to have the sibling F1F7, F2M13 is shown to be in a sibling relationship with one of the other F2– individuals, F10F186 has a sibling F10M173, and so on).

By contrast, the negative examples (such as F2F24, F6F72, F10M180, F5M60, … F7F114) do not have any (or any explicitly asserted) “hasSibling” relationship.

Because every individual is a Person (and many are also marked as “Female” or “Male”) the simplest discriminating expression is not a gender restriction but one on having a sibling.

Thus, a complex class expression that covers the positive examples but not the negatives is:

 Person and (hasSibling some Person)

In DL syntax you might write this as:

 Person ⊓ (hasSibling some Person)

This expression says “the class of all persons that have at least one sibling (which is itself a Person)”. This is the DL‐Learner style answer analogous to the sample (“Male and (hasSibling some Thing)”) but for our mixed–gender set.
