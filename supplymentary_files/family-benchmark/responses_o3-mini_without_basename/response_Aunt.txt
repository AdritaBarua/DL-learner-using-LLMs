One acceptable answer was one that “cut‐across” the many families by selecting exactly the kind of female person who is known to be “in a family” (that is, not a founder) – that is, one who is known to have at least one sibling. For example, one DL–learner solution was:

  Female and (hasSibling some Thing)

That is, every positive example is female and is recorded as having at least one sibling, whereas many of the negative examples (which include the “first‐generation” founders and other isolated individuals) lack any “hasSibling” assertion. (In other words, the DL–learner “learned” that among the females only those with some sibling‐relationship occur in the “target” set.) 

Because the knowledge base is very rich and several different “views” are possible, other answers in which the defining conjunct “Female” is further conjoined with a restriction on a family–role (for example, one that distinguishes child–generation from parent–generation) are possible. But the simplest answer generated by DL–Learner was

  Female and (hasSibling some Thing)
