One acceptable answer was to require that a “grandgrandson” is a male that has a chain of three parental links. In DL‐syntax one may write this as:

  Male and (hasParent some (hasParent some (hasParent some Person)))

In other words, an individual x is a grandgrandson if

  (1) x is Male, and 
  (2) there is a y with x hasParent y, 
  (3) and a z with y hasParent z, 
  (4) and a w with z hasParent w (where w is a Person).

When one checks the positive examples (ex:F2M18, ex:F2M25, …, ex:F10M199), one finds that each has such a three‐step “hasParent” chain, while the negatives (for example ex:F3M45, ex:F6M85, …, ex:F10F193) do not have a three‐level parent–child ancestry. 

Thus, one acceptable complex class expression for Grandgrandson is:

  Male and (hasParent some (hasParent some (hasParent some Person)))
