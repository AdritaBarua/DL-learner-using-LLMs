We can see from the knowledge base that a “mother” is always a female person who is known to be a parent. In other words, every positive example in the Mother set is a female (an instance of Female) that is related by the property hasChild to at least one other individual, while many of the negative examples (even those that are female) fail to exhibit a hasChild relationship.

For example, compare the following:
• A positive example such as ex:F1F3 is a Female—and from the relationships we know that she is the parent of someone (directly or indirectly via a hasChild relation).
• In contrast, a negative example such as ex:F10F200 (which is also female) does not appear as having any hasChild relationship.

If we use the same “pattern‐learning” as in the older DL‑Learner example for Brother (“Male and (hasSibling some Thing)”), then the Mother class can be characterized by the following complex class expression in OWL (using Manchester syntax):

  Female and (hasChild some Thing)

That is, an individual will be classified as a Mother if and only if it is Female and it has at least one child.

Thus, based on the logical analysis of the given positive and negative examples, the complex class expression for Mother is:

  Female and (hasChild some Thing)
