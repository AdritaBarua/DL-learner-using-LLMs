One acceptable answer was to “build” Grandgrandmother by “climbing down”
two generations of children. In other words, one may define it as those females who have at least one child who in turn has at least one child. (In DL–Learner‐syntax one may also say that a Grandgrandmother is a female that has a grandchild.) For example, one acceptable complex class expression is

  Female and (hasChild some (hasChild some Thing)).

That is, an individual is a Grandgrandmother if it is a Female and there is some x such that it hasChild x and x in turn hasChild some Thing.

To explain briefly:

• Every one of the positive examples (such as ex:F2F19, ex:F2F28, ex:F2F10, ex:F3F46, …, ex:F10F172) is an individual with a female‐name (the “F” in the name) and, when one inspects the relationships in the knowledge base, one finds that (directly or indirectly) they are “progenitors” – they have a child who in turn is a parent (i.e. they have a grandchild).

• In contrast, an individual like ex:F10F174 (or ex:F10F191, ex:F10F198, etc.) although female, does not have a two‐step “hasChild” chain (for instance, F10F174 is known to have a child but that child is never recorded as having a child of its own). Also, many of the negatives are males (or have no such chain).

Thus, according to the given knowledge base and the examples, we can say that one complex class expression for Grandgrandmother is:

  Female and (hasChild some (hasChild some Thing))

Any expression equivalent to that one is an acceptable answer.
