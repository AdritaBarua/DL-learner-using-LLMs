To find a complex class expression that distinguishes the positive examples from the negative examples, we need to analyze the relationships and properties that apply to the positive examples but not to the negative examples.

### Positive Examples:
- **Serena**
  - Parent: Maria, Dino
  - Siblings: Luigi, Ombretta

- **Ombretta**
  - Parent: Maria, Dino
  - Siblings: Luigi, Serena

- **Valentina**
  - Parent: Francesco, Rosanna
  - Siblings: Antonella, Milly

- **Milly**
  - Parent: Francesco, Rosanna
  - Siblings: Antonella, Valentina

- **Antonella**
  - Parent: Francesco, Rosanna
  - Siblings: Valentina, Milly

- **Marisella**
  - Parent: Mauro, Nella
  - Sibling: Giovanna

- **Giovanna**
  - Parent: Mauro, Nella
  - Sibling: Marisella

- **Nella**
  - Parent: NonnaLina, NonnoLuigi
  - Children: Marisella, Giovanna
  - Sibling: Dino

### Negative Examples:
- **Luigi**
  - Parent: Maria, Dino
  - Siblings: Serena, Ombretta

- **Dino**
  - Parent: NonnaLina, NonnoLuigi
  - Children: Luigi, Ombretta, Serena
  - Sibling: Nella

### Analysis:
1. **Parent Relationships**: 
   - Positive examples have parents who are not Dino or Maria.
   - Negative examples have Dino as a parent.

2. **Sibling Relationships**:
   - Positive examples have siblings who are not Luigi or Dino.
   - Negative examples have siblings who are Nella or Serena.

3. **Class Membership**:
   - All positive examples are instances of `Female`.
   - Negative examples are instances of `Male`.

### Complex Class Expression:
Given the analysis, a distinguishing feature is that the positive examples are all `Female` and have a parent who is not `Dino`. Therefore, the complex class expression can be:

```plaintext
Female and (hasParent some (not {Dino}))
```

This expression captures the fact that the positive examples are all female and do not have Dino as a parent, which distinguishes them from the negative examples.
