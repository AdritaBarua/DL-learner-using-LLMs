To derive a complex class expression that applies to the positive examples but not to the negative examples, we need to analyze the relationships and properties associated with each individual in the knowledge base.

### Positive Examples:
1. **Luigi**: 
   - Male
   - hasParent: Dino, Maria
   - hasSibling: Ombretta, Serena

2. **Maria**:
   - Female
   - hasChild: Serena, Ombretta, Luigi
   - hasSibling: Rosanna

3. **Dino**:
   - Male
   - hasChild: Luigi, Ombretta, Serena
   - hasSibling: Nella
   - hasParent: NonnoLuigi, NonnaLina

4. **Serena**:
   - Female
   - hasParent: Dino, Maria
   - hasSibling: Luigi, Ombretta

5. **Ombretta**:
   - Female
   - hasParent: Dino, Maria
   - hasSibling: Luigi, Serena

6. **Francesco**:
   - Male
   - hasChild: Antonella, Valentina, Milly
   - hasSibling: Giuseppe
   - hasParent: Girolamo, Carmela

7. **Anna**:
   - Female
   - hasSibling: NonnoLuigi

### Negative Examples:
1. **Dora**:
   - Female
   - hasChild: Maria, Rosanna

2. **Gianni**:
   - Male
   - hasChild: Maria, Rosanna

3. **Luca**:
   - Male
   - hasParent: Luciano, Lucrezia

### Analysis:
- **Common Traits in Positive Examples**:
  - All positive examples are either Male or Female, which is a subclass of Person.
  - Many positive examples have the property `hasSibling`.
  - Many positive examples have the property `hasParent` or `hasChild`.

- **Differences with Negative Examples**:
  - Negative examples do not share the same sibling relationships as the positive examples.
  - Negative examples do not have the same parent-child relationships as the positive examples.

### Complex Class Expression:
Given the analysis, a complex class expression that captures the commonalities among the positive examples and distinguishes them from the negative examples could be:

```plaintext
(Person and (hasSibling some Thing) and (hasParent some Thing or hasChild some Thing))
```

This expression captures individuals who are Persons and have at least one sibling, and either have a parent or a child, which aligns with the characteristics of the positive examples and not the negative ones.
