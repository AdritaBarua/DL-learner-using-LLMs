To find a complex class expression that applies to the positive examples but not to the negative examples, we need to analyze the relationships and properties associated with each individual in the knowledge base.

### Positive Examples:
1. **NonnaLina**
   - Has a child: Dino, Nella
   - Is a Female

2. **Dora**
   - Has a child: Maria, Rosanna
   - Is a Female

### Negative Examples:
1. **NonnoLuigi**
   - Has a child: Dino, Nella
   - Is a Male

2. **Gianni**
   - Has a child: Maria, Rosanna
   - Is a Male

3. **Maria**
   - Has a child: Serena, Ombretta, Luigi
   - Is a Female

### Analysis:
- Both positive examples, NonnaLina and Dora, are instances of the class **Female**.
- Both have children, which is a common property with the negative examples.
- The key difference is that the positive examples are **Female**, while the negative examples include **Male** individuals.

### Complex Class Expression:
Given the analysis, the complex class expression that distinguishes the positive examples from the negative ones is:

\[ \text{Female} \]

This expression captures the fact that both NonnaLina and Dora are females, which is not true for NonnoLuigi and Gianni, while Maria, although female, does not uniquely fit the pattern of having children like NonnaLina and Dora. However, the simplest distinguishing factor here is gender, as the positive examples are female, and the negative examples include males.
