To find a complex class expression that applies to the positive examples but not to the negative examples, we need to analyze the relationships and properties of the individuals in both sets.

### Positive Examples:
1. **NonnoLuigi**
   - Instance of `Male`
   - Has a sibling relationship with `Anna`
   - Has children: `Nella`, `Dino`

2. **Isidoro**
   - Instance of `Male`
   - Has a child: `Luciano`

3. **Gianni**
   - Instance of `Male`
   - Has children: `Rosanna`, `Maria`

### Negative Examples:
- **Giovanna**, **Marisella**, **Ombretta**, **Serena**, **Valentina**, **Luca**, **Luigi**, **Dino**, **Maria**, **Mauro**, **Nella**, **Miriam**, **NonnaLina**, **Carmela**

### Analysis:
- All positive examples are instances of `Male`.
- All positive examples have the `hasChild` property.
- The negative examples include both males and females, but none of the negative examples have the same combination of properties as the positive examples.

### Complex Class Expression:
Given the analysis, the complex class expression that applies to the positive examples but not to the negative examples is:

\[ \text{Male} \, \text{and} \, (\text{hasChild some Thing}) \]

This expression captures the fact that the positive examples are all males who have at least one child, which distinguishes them from the negative examples.
