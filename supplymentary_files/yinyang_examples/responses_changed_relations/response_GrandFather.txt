To derive a complex class expression for the concept of "GrandFather" based on the given positive and negative examples, we need to analyze the relationships and properties that distinguish the positive examples from the negative ones.

### Positive Examples:
- **NonnaLina**: 
  - Has a child relationship with Dino and Nella.
  - Is a Female.

- **Dora**: 
  - Has a child relationship with Rosanna and Maria.
  - Is a Female.

### Negative Examples:
- **NonnoLuigi**: 
  - Has a child relationship with Dino and Nella.
  - Is a Male.

- **Gianni**: 
  - Has a child relationship with Rosanna and Maria.
  - Is a Male.

- **Maria**: 
  - Has a child relationship with Serena, Ombretta, and Luigi.
  - Is a Female.

### Analysis:
1. **Gender**: The positive examples are both Female, while the negative examples include both Male and Female. Therefore, gender alone does not distinguish the positive examples from the negative ones.

2. **Parent-Child Relationships**:
   - Both positive examples have children who themselves have children (i.e., they are grandparents).
   - The negative examples include individuals who are either not grandparents or are male grandparents.

3. **Grandparent Relationship**:
   - The positive examples are grandparents, meaning they have children who also have children.
   - The negative examples either do not have this property or are male grandparents.

### Complex Class Expression:
To capture the concept of "GrandFather" based on the given examples, we need to focus on the property of being a grandparent and being male. However, since the positive examples are female, the task seems to be about finding a complex class expression for "GrandMother" instead. 

For "GrandMother", the complex class expression would be:

```plaintext
Female and (hasChild some (hasChild some Thing))
```

This expression states that a "GrandMother" is a Female who has a child, and that child also has a child, which fits the positive examples (NonnaLina and Dora) and excludes the negative examples (NonnoLuigi, Gianni, and Maria).
