To derive a complex class expression for the concept of "Friend" based on the given positive and negative examples, we need to analyze the relationships and properties that are common among the positive examples but not present in the negative examples. Let's break down the information:

### Positive Examples:
1. **Luigi**
   - Male
   - Has Parent: Maria, Dino
   - Has Sibling: Ombretta, Serena

2. **Maria**
   - Female
   - Has Child: Serena, Ombretta, Luigi
   - Has Sibling: Rosanna

3. **Dino**
   - Male
   - Has Child: Luigi, Ombretta, Serena
   - Has Sibling: Nella

4. **Serena**
   - Female
   - Has Parent: Maria, Dino
   - Has Sibling: Luigi, Ombretta

5. **Ombretta**
   - Female
   - Has Parent: Maria, Dino
   - Has Sibling: Luigi, Serena

6. **Francesco**
   - Male
   - Has Child: Antonella, Valentina, Milly
   - Has Sibling: Giuseppe

7. **Anna**
   - Female
   - Has Sibling: NonnoLuigi

### Negative Examples:
1. **Dora**
   - Female
   - Has Child: Rosanna, Maria

2. **Gianni**
   - Male
   - Has Child: Rosanna, Maria

3. **Luca**
   - Male
   - Has Parent: Luciano, Lucrezia

### Analysis:
- **Common Traits in Positive Examples:**
  - All positive examples are either parents or siblings.
  - They have relationships with other individuals in the knowledge base, either as a parent or a sibling.
  - They are all instances of either the class 'Male' or 'Female', which are subclasses of 'Person'.

- **Traits in Negative Examples:**
  - The negative examples do not share the same sibling or parent relationships with the positive examples.
  - They do not have the same interconnectedness as the positive examples.

### Complex Class Expression:
Based on the analysis, a potential complex class expression for "Friend" could be:

```plaintext
Person and (hasSibling some Person or hasChild some Person)
```

This expression captures the idea that a "Friend" in this context is a person who has either a sibling or a child, which aligns with the relationships observed in the positive examples and not in the negative examples.
