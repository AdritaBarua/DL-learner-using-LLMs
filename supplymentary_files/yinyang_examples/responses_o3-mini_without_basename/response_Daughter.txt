The answer is simply:

  kb:Female

Let me explain briefly:

All of the positive examples—
  kb:Serena, kb:Ombretta, kb:Valentina, kb:Milly, kb:Antonella, kb:Marisella, kb:Giovanna, and kb:Nella—
are explicitly asserted to be instances of the class Female, whereas the negative examples (kb:Luigi and kb:Dino) are asserted to be Male. (In this ontology Male and Female are used to classify persons so that being Female is what distinguishes the positives from the negatives.) 

In Manchester syntax the atomic class kb:Female is a valid complex class expression that covers the positives and excludes the negatives.
