The answer is:

  kb:Female and (kb:hasChild some (kb:hasChild some Thing))

Here's some explanation:

• Both kb:NonnaLina and kb:Dora are female individuals.
• In the ontology, each “hasChild” relationship has values of type Person. Moreover, by “kb:hasChild some (kb:hasChild some Thing)” we require that the individual has at least one child who in turn has at least one child—that is, the individual is a grandparent.
• Looking at the assertions:
 – kb:NonnaLina has children kb:Dino and kb:Nella; for example, kb:Dino is a parent (he is related by “hasChild” to kb:Luigi, kb:Ombretta, or kb:Serena).
 – kb:Dora has a child kb:Rosanna (and also kb:Maria as a child), and kb:Rosanna in turn is a parent (kb:Rosanna has children kb:Valentina, kb:Milly and kb:Antonella).
• In contrast, among the negatives:
 – kb:NonnoLuigi and kb:Gianni are male, so they are immediately excluded by “kb:Female.”
 – kb:Maria (although female) has a child kb:Luigi but there is no assertion that kb:Luigi is a parent; hence kb:Maria does not satisfy “hasChild some (hasChild some Thing).”

Thus the complex class expression that covers the positives but not the negatives is:

  kb:Female and (kb:hasChild some (kb:hasChild some Thing))
