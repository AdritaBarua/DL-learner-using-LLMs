We can note that each of the three positive individuals is male and is “at least a grandfather” – that is, each has a child who in turn has a child. For example:

• kb:NonnoLuigi is male and has a child kb:Nella (and also kb:Dino) and kb:Nella in turn has a child (kb:Giovanna).
• kb:Isidoro is male and has a child kb:Luciano; kb:Luciano has a child kb:Luca.
• kb:Gianni is male and has a child kb:Rosanna; kb:Rosanna in turn has children (for instance kb:Valentina, kb:Milly, or kb:Antonella).

In contrast, none of the negative individuals satisfy “being male and having a child who has a child.” (Some negatives are male (kb:Luigi, kb:Dino, kb:Mauro) but none of them have a descendant two generations down; others are female.)

Thus one complex class expression in Manchester syntax that fits the positive and excludes the negative examples is:

  kb:Male and (kb:hasChild some (kb:hasChild some kb:Person))

This expression reads as “the class of all individuals that are male and that have at least one child who itself has at least one child.”
