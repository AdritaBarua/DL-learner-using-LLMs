To find the complex class expression for "Parent" using the given positive and negative examples, we need to identify the properties and class memberships that apply to all the positive examples but none of the negative examples.

### Positive Examples:
- **kb:Maria**

### Analysis:
1. **Property Analysis:**
   - The positive examples are all individuals who have a `hasChild` relationship with at least one other individual.
   - The negative examples do not consistently have this property.

2. **Class Membership:**
   - The positive examples include both males and females, so class membership like `Male` or `Female` is not a distinguishing factor.

3. **Complex Class Expression:**
   - The distinguishing feature of the positive examples is the presence of the `hasChild` property.

### Conclusion:
The complex class expression for "Parent" that applies to all the positive examples and none of the negative examples is:

\[ \text{Person} \, \text{and} \, (\text{hasChild some Person}) \]

This expression indicates that a "Parent" is any individual of class `Person` who has at least one `hasChild` relationship with another individual of class `Person`.
