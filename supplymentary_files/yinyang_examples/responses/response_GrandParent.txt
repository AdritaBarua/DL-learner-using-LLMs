### Analysis:
The positive examples are all individuals who have children, and those children have children of their own, making them grandparents. The negative examples do not have this property.

### Complex Class Expression:
The complex class expression for "GrandParent" can be defined as follows:

- An individual is a "GrandParent" if they have a child who also has a child.

In OWL, this can be expressed as:

```plaintext
Person and (hasChild some (hasChild some Thing))
```

This expression means that a "GrandParent" is a "Person" who has at least one child, and that child also has at least one child. This matches the pattern seen in the positive examples and excludes the negative examples.
