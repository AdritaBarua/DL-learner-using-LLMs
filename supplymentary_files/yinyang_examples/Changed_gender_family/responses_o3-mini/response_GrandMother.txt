A common way to “explain” what it means to be a grandmother is that she must be a female who has at least one child that in turn has at least one child. In Manchester syntax the standard definition would be written as follows:

  Female and (hasChild some (hasChild some Thing))

Let’s briefly check this expression against the examples:

• Both kb:NonnaLina and kb:Dora (the positive examples) have at least one child who is a parent—that is, they have grandchildren.

• kb:NonnoLuigi and kb:Gianni (negative examples) do have children (and even grandchildren) but they are not female according to the intended meaning of the names.

• kb:Maria is female but none of her children have any children, so she does not satisfy (hasChild some (hasChild some Thing)).

Thus, the complex class expression

  Female and (hasChild some (hasChild some Thing))

selects exactly the individuals that have the structure of a “grandmother” according to the knowledge base.
