To find the complex class expression for "Daughter" using the given positive and negative examples, we need to identify the properties and class memberships that apply to all the positive examples but not to any of the negative examples.

### Positive Examples:
- **Serena**
- **Ombretta**
- **Valentina**
- **Milly**
- **Antonella**
- **Marisella**
- **Giovanna**
- **Nella**

### Negative Examples:
- **Luigi**
- **Dino**

### Analysis:

1. **Class Membership:**
   - All positive examples are instances of the class `Person`.
   - All positive examples are instances of the class `Female`.

2. **Properties:**
   - All positive examples have a `hasParent` relationship with another `Person`.
   - None of the positive examples have a `hasChild` relationship, which is a common property for the negative examples (Luigi and Dino both have children).

3. **Sibling Relationships:**
   - Some positive examples have `hasSibling` relationships, but this is not consistent across all positive examples.

### Complex Class Expression:

Given the analysis, the complex class expression for "Daughter" can be defined as:

**Female and (hasParent some Person) and not (hasChild some Thing)**

This expression captures the essence of being a "Daughter" in this ontology: being a female person who has a parent but does not have children, which distinguishes the positive examples from the negative ones.
