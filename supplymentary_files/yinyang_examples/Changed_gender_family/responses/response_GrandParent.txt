To determine the complex class expression for the concept of 'GrandParent' using the given positive and negative examples, we need to identify the properties and relationships that are common to all positive examples but not present in any of the negative examples.

### Positive Examples:
1. **NonnaLina**
   - hasChild: Dino, Nella

2. **NonnoLuigi**
   - hasChild: Dino, Nella

3. **Carmela**
   - hasChild: Francesco, Giuseppe

4. **Girolamo**
   - hasChild: Francesco, Giuseppe

5. **Isidoro**
   - hasChild: Luciano

### Negative Examples:
- Giovanna
- Marisella
- Ombretta
- Serena
- Valentina
- Luca
- Luigi
- Dino
- Maria
- Mauro
- Nella
- Miriam

### Analysis:
The positive examples share the characteristic of having children who themselves have children, which is the defining feature of a grandparent. We need to express this in terms of the ontology's properties.

### Complex Class Expression:
The complex class expression for 'GrandParent' can be defined as follows:

- A 'GrandParent' is a 'Person' who has a 'hasChild' relationship with another 'Person', and that child also has a 'hasChild' relationship with another 'Person'.

In logical terms, this can be expressed as:

```
Person and (hasChild some (Person and (hasChild some Person)))
```

This expression captures the essence of being a grandparent: having a child who is also a parent. This expression applies to all the positive examples and none of the negative examples, as required.
