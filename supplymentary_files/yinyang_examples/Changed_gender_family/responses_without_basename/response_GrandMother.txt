To determine the complex class expression that applies to the positive examples but not to the negative examples, we need to analyze the relationships and class memberships of the individuals in the knowledge base.

### Positive Examples:
1. **NonnaLina**
   - Class: Person, Male
   - Relationships: 
     - hasChild: Nella, Dino

2. **Dora**
   - Class: Male
   - Relationships:
     - hasChild: Rosanna, Maria

### Negative Examples:
1. **NonnoLuigi**
   - Class: Person, Female
   - Relationships:
     - hasChild: Nella, Dino
     - hasSibling: Anna

2. **Gianni**
   - Class: Female
   - Relationships:
     - hasChild: Maria, Rosanna

3. **Maria**
   - Class: Male, Person
   - Relationships:
     - hasChild: Luigi, Serena, Ombretta
     - hasParent: Dora
     - hasSibling: Rosanna

### Analysis:
- **Class Membership**: Both positive examples are instances of the class `Male`.
- **Relationships**:
  - Both NonnaLina and Dora have the `hasChild` relationship with at least two individuals.
  - NonnaLina and Dora do not have the `hasSibling` relationship, which is present in NonnoLuigi.

### Complex Class Expression:
Given the analysis, the complex class expression that distinguishes the positive examples from the negative ones is:

```plaintext
Male and (hasChild min 2 Person) and not (hasSibling some Thing)
```

This expression captures the fact that both NonnaLina and Dora are classified as `Male`, have at least two children, and do not have any siblings, which differentiates them from the negative examples.
