To determine the complex class expression that applies to the positive examples but not to the negative examples, we need to analyze the relationships and class memberships of the individuals in the knowledge base.

### Positive Examples:
1. **Luigi**: 
   - Instance of `Female` and `Person`.
   - Has a sibling relationship with `Serena` and `Ombretta`.
   - Has a parent relationship with `Dino` and `Maria`.

2. **Maria**:
   - Instance of `Male` and `Person`.
   - Has a child relationship with `Luigi`, `Serena`, and `Ombretta`.
   - Has a sibling relationship with `Rosanna`.

3. **Dino**:
   - Instance of `Female` and `Person`.
   - Has a child relationship with `Luigi`, `Serena`, and `Ombretta`.
   - Has a parent relationship with `NonnoLuigi` and `NonnaLina`.
   - Has a sibling relationship with `Nella`.

4. **Serena**:
   - Instance of `Male` and `Person`.
   - Has a sibling relationship with `Luigi` and `Ombretta`.
   - Has a parent relationship with `Dino` and `Maria`.

5. **Ombretta**:
   - Instance of `Male` and `Person`.
   - Has a sibling relationship with `Luigi` and `Serena`.
   - Has a parent relationship with `Dino` and `Maria`.

6. **Francesco**:
   - Instance of `Female` and `Person`.
   - Has a child relationship with `Milly`, `Antonella`, and `Valentina`.
   - Has a sibling relationship with `Giuseppe`.
   - Has a parent relationship with `Carmela` and `Girolamo`.

7. **Anna**:
   - Instance of `Male` and `Person`.
   - Has a sibling relationship with `NonnoLuigi`.

### Negative Examples:
1. **Dora**:
   - Instance of `Male` and `Person`.
   - Has a child relationship with `Rosanna` and `Maria`.

2. **Gianni**:
   - Instance of `Female` and `Person`.
   - Has a child relationship with `Maria` and `Rosanna`.

3. **Luca**:
   - Instance of `Female` and `Person`.
   - Has a parent relationship with `Luciano` and `Lucrezia`.

### Analysis:
- **Common Traits in Positive Examples**:
  - All positive examples have a `hasSibling` relationship.
  - Most positive examples are involved in a `hasChild` or `hasParent` relationship.
  - Positive examples are instances of either `Male` or `Female`.

- **Traits in Negative Examples**:
  - Negative examples do not have a `hasSibling` relationship with the positive examples.
  - Negative examples are involved in `hasChild` relationships but not with the same individuals as the positive examples.

### Complex Class Expression:
Based on the analysis, a complex class expression that captures the positive examples but not the negative ones could be:

```plaintext
(Person and (hasSibling some Thing))
```

This expression indicates that the individual is a `Person` and has at least one sibling, which is a common trait among the positive examples but not the negative ones.
