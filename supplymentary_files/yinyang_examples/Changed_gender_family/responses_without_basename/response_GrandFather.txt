To determine the complex class expression that applies to the positive examples but not to the negative examples, we need to analyze the characteristics and relationships of the individuals in both sets based on the given ontology.

### Positive Examples:
1. **NonnoLuigi**
   - Instance of: Female, Person
   - Relationships: 
     - hasSibling: Anna
     - hasChild: Nella, Dino

2. **Isidoro**
   - Instance of: Female, Person
   - Relationships:
     - hasChild: Luciano

3. **Gianni**
   - Instance of: Female, Person
   - Relationships:
     - hasChild: Maria, Rosanna

### Negative Examples:
- **Giovanna, Marisella, Ombretta, Serena, Valentina, Luca, Luigi, Dino, Maria, Mauro, Nella, Miriam, NonnaLina, Carmela**
  - These individuals have various relationships and class memberships, but we need to find what distinguishes the positive examples from these.

### Analysis:
1. **Class Membership:**
   - All positive examples are instances of the class `Female`.

2. **Relationships:**
   - All positive examples have the `hasChild` relationship with at least one individual.
   - None of the positive examples are mentioned to have a `hasParent` relationship in the given data.

3. **Distinguishing Features:**
   - The positive examples are all `Female` and have the `hasChild` relationship with at least one individual.
   - The negative examples either do not have the `hasChild` relationship or are not `Female`.

### Complex Class Expression:
Based on the analysis, the complex class expression that applies to the positive examples but not to the negative examples is:

\[ \text{Female} \, \text{and} \, (\text{hasChild} \, \text{some} \, \text{Thing}) \]

This expression captures the fact that the positive examples are all instances of `Female` and have at least one child, which distinguishes them from the negative examples.
