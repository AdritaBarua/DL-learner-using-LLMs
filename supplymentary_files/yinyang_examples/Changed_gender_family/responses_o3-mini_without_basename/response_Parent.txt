All of the individuals in the positive set are those that have at least one child (i.e. they are “parents”), while none of the negatives have any hasChild‑edges. For example, kb:Maria has children kb:Luigi, kb:Serena and kb:Ombretta; kb:Nella has children kb:Giovanna and kb:Marisella; kb:Rosanna is the parent of kb:Milly (and others); and similarly each of the other positives has at least one hasChild relationship. In contrast, none of the negatives (kb:Giovanna, kb:Marisella, kb:Ombretta, kb:Serena, kb:Valentina, kb:Luca, kb:Luigi) is given as having any children.

Thus one complex class expression that is true for all the positives but not for the negatives is to require that the individual has some (at least one) child. In Manchester syntax one acceptable answer is:

  Person and (hasChild some Thing)

Since every hasChild–value is a Person (by the range axiom) you could also write

  hasChild some Person

Either form is correct; the key is that the expression “hasChild some …” picks out exactly those individuals that act as parents.
