The learned expression picks out those person‐individuals that are known to have a parent. In Manchester syntax (using the kb: prefix) a suitable answer is:

  kb:Person and (kb:hasParent some kb:Person)

Let’s explain briefly. Every one of the positive examples—
 kb:Luigi, kb:Maria, kb:Dino, kb:Serena, kb:Ombretta and kb:Luca—
has at least one asserted kb:hasParent relation (for example, kb:Luigi has parents kb:Maria and kb:Dino, kb:Maria has parents kb:Dora and kb:Gianni, and so on), whereas the negative examples (kb:Dora and kb:Gianni) have no kb:hasParent statements. Thus the class expression

  kb:Person and (kb:hasParent some kb:Person)

covers exactly the intended individuals.
