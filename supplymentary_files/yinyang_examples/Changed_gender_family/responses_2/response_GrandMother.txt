To determine the complex class expression for "GrandMother" based on the given positive and negative examples, we need to analyze the relationships and class memberships of the individuals in the knowledge base.

### Positive Examples:
1. **NonnaLina**
   - Relationships:
     - `hasChild`: Dino, Nella
   - Class Membership: Person, Male

2. **Dora**
   - Relationships:
     - `hasChild`: Rosanna, Maria
   - Class Membership: Male

### Negative Examples:
1. **NonnoLuigi**
   - Relationships:
     - `hasChild`: Nella, Dino
     - `hasSibling`: Anna
   - Class Membership: Person, Female

2. **Gianni**
   - Relationships:
     - `hasChild`: Rosanna, Maria
   - Class Membership: Female

3. **Maria**
   - Relationships:
     - `hasChild`: Serena, Ombretta, Luigi
     - `hasParent`: Gianni, Dora
     - `hasSibling`: Rosanna
   - Class Membership: Person, Male

### Analysis:
- Both **NonnaLina** and **Dora** have children who themselves have children, indicating a grandparent relationship.
- Both are instances of the class `Male`.
- The negative examples either do not have children who have children or are not instances of `Male`.

### Complex Class Expression:
To capture the essence of being a "GrandMother" based on the positive examples and excluding the negative examples, we can construct the following class expression:

- **GrandMother**: `Male and (hasChild some (hasChild some Thing))`

This expression states that a "GrandMother" is an instance of `Male` who has a child, and that child also has a child, which fits the pattern observed in the positive examples and excludes the negative examples.
