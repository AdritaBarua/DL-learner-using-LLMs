To determine the complex class expression for "Sister" based on the given positive and negative examples, we need to analyze the relationships and class memberships in the ontology.

### Analysis:

1. **Class Membership:**
   - Positive examples (Antonella, Giovanna, Maria, Marisella, Milly, Miriam, Nella, Ombretta, Rosanna, Serena, Valentina) are all instances of the class `Person`.
   - Negative examples (Dino, Luigi, Mauro, Francesco, Giuseppe, Carmela) are also instances of the class `Person`.

2. **Gender Classification:**
   - The positive examples are instances of the class `Male`.
   - The negative examples are instances of the class `Female`.

3. **Sibling Relationships:**
   - The property `hasSibling` is a `SymmetricProperty`, meaning if A has a sibling B, then B has a sibling A.
   - Positive examples have sibling relationships with other individuals, as indicated in the knowledge base.

4. **Parent-Child Relationships:**
   - The positive examples have parent-child relationships, but this is not a distinguishing factor between the positive and negative examples.

### Complex Class Expression:

Given the analysis, the distinguishing feature of the positive examples is that they are all classified as `Male` and have sibling relationships. The negative examples are classified as `Female`. Therefore, the complex class expression for "Sister" can be derived as follows:

- **Sister:** `Male and (hasSibling some Thing)`

This expression captures the fact that the positive examples are all `Male` and have at least one sibling, which aligns with the definition of a "Sister" in this context.
