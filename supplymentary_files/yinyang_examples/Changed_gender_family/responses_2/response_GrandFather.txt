To determine the complex class expression for "GrandFather" based on the given positive and negative examples, we need to analyze the relationships and class memberships of the individuals in the knowledge base.

### Positive Examples:
1. **NonnoLuigi**
   - Has a child: Nella, Dino
   - Has a sibling: Anna
   - Is a Person and Male

2. **Isidoro**
   - Has a child: Luciano
   - Is a Person and Male

3. **Gianni**
   - Has a child: Rosanna, Maria
   - Is a Person and Male

### Negative Examples:
- **Giovanna, Marisella, Ombretta, Serena, Valentina, Luca, Luigi, Dino, Maria, Mauro, Nella, Miriam, NonnaLina, Carmela**

### Analysis:
- The positive examples (NonnoLuigi, Isidoro, Gianni) are all instances of the class "Male" and have children.
- Additionally, these children have their own children, making the positive examples grandfathers.
- The negative examples do not fit this pattern; they either do not have children or are not male.

### Complex Class Expression:
To capture the essence of being a "GrandFather," we need to express that an individual is a male who has a child, and that child also has a child. This can be expressed using OWL class expressions as follows:

```plaintext
Male and (hasChild some (hasChild some Thing))
```

This expression states that a "GrandFather" is a male who has at least one child, and that child has at least one child, which aligns with the characteristics of the positive examples and excludes the negative examples.
