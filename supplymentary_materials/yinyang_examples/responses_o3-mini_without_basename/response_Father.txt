We start by noting that all of the positive examples (kb:Dino, kb:Francesco, kb:Mauro, kb:Giggino) are instances of Male and each one is asserted to have at least one child:

 • kb:Dino has a hasChild relation (with kb:Luigi, kb:Ombretta, and kb:Serena).  
 • kb:Francesco has a hasChild relation (with kb:Antonella, kb:Valentina, and kb:Milly).  
 • kb:Mauro has a hasChild relation (with kb:Marisella and kb:Giovanna).  
 • kb:Giggino has a hasChild relation (with kb:Felice).

On the negative side several individuals (such as kb:Giovanna, kb:Marisella, kb:Ombretta, kb:Serena, kb:Valentina) are not Male. In addition, the only males among the negatives (e.g. kb:Luca and kb:Luigi) do not have any hasChild assertions.

Thus, the class expression that is true of all the positive examples yet false of all the negatives is one that says “an individual is male and it has at least one child”. In Manchester syntax this is written as:

  Male and (hasChild some Thing)

This is the complex class expression that distinguishes our given positive examples from the negatives.
