To derive a complex class expression for the concept of "GrandMother" based on the given positive and negative examples, we need to analyze the relationships and properties that distinguish the positive examples from the negative ones.

### Analysis:

**Positive Examples:**
1. **NonnoLuigi**: 
   - Instance of `Male`.
   - Has a `hasChild` relationship with `Dino` and `Nella`.
   - Has a `hasSibling` relationship with `Anna`.

2. **Isidoro**:
   - Instance of `Male`.
   - Has a `hasChild` relationship with `Luciano`.

3. **Gianni**:
   - Instance of `Male`.
   - Has a `hasChild` relationship with `Rosanna` and `Maria`.

**Negative Examples:**
- All negative examples are either instances of `Female` or have no `hasChild` relationships that lead to a grandchild.

### Observations:
- The positive examples are all instances of `Male` and have children who themselves have children (i.e., they are grandfathers).
- The negative examples include instances of `Female` and individuals who do not have the necessary `hasChild` relationships to qualify as grandfathers.

### Complex Class Expression:
Given that the task is to find a complex class expression for "GrandMother," but the positive examples provided are all male, it seems there might be a misunderstanding in the task. However, if we were to derive a class expression for "GrandFather" based on the positive examples, it would be:

```plaintext
Male and (hasChild some (hasChild some Person))
```

This expression states that a "GrandFather" is a `Male` who has a child, and that child also has a child (i.e., a grandchild).

If the task indeed requires a class expression for "GrandMother," then the positive examples should include instances of `Female` with similar relationships. However, based on the current examples, the expression above is more aligned with the concept of "GrandFather."
