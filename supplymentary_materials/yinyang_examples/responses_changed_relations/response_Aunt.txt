To derive a complex class expression for the concept of "Aunt" based on the given positive and negative examples, we need to analyze the relationships and properties that apply to the positive examples but not to the negative examples.

### Analysis:

1. **Positive Examples:**
   - **Luigi:** Male, hasParent relationships with Maria and Dino, hasSibling relationships with Ombretta and Serena.
   - **Maria:** Female, hasChild relationships with Serena, Luigi, and Ombretta, hasSibling relationship with Rosanna.
   - **Dino:** Male, hasChild relationships with Luigi, Ombretta, and Serena, hasSibling relationship with Nella.
   - **Serena:** Female, hasParent relationships with Maria and Dino, hasSibling relationships with Luigi and Ombretta.
   - **Ombretta:** Female, hasParent relationships with Maria and Dino, hasSibling relationships with Luigi and Serena.
   - **Luca:** Male, hasParent relationships with Luciano and Lucrezia.

2. **Negative Examples:**
   - **Dora:** Female, hasChild relationships with Maria and Rosanna.
   - **Gianni:** Male, hasChild relationships with Maria and Rosanna.

### Observations:

- The positive examples include both males and females, but the concept of "Aunt" typically applies to females.
- The positive examples have relationships indicating they are siblings of a parent of a child, which is a key characteristic of an "Aunt."
- The negative examples, Dora and Gianni, do not have sibling relationships with a parent of a child in the positive examples.

### Complex Class Expression for "Aunt":

Based on the analysis, the complex class expression for "Aunt" can be derived as follows:

- **Female**: The individual must be female.
- **hasSibling some (hasChild some Person)**: The individual must have a sibling who has a child.

Thus, the complex class expression for "Aunt" is:

```plaintext
Female and (hasSibling some (hasChild some Person))
```

This expression captures the essence of an "Aunt" as a female who is a sibling of someone who has a child, which aligns with the relationships observed in the positive examples and not in the negative examples.
