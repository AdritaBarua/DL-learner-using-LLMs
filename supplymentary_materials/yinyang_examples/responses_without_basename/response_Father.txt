To determine the complex class expression that applies to the positive examples but not to the negative examples, we need to analyze the relationships and properties associated with each individual in the knowledge base.

### Positive Examples:
1. **Dino**:
   - Male
   - Has children: Luigi, Ombretta, Serena
   - Has sibling: Nella
   - Has parent: NonnaLina, NonnoLuigi

2. **Francesco**:
   - Male
   - Has children: Antonella, Valentina, Milly
   - Has sibling: Giuseppe
   - Has parent: Girolamo, Carmela

3. **Mauro**:
   - Male
   - Has children: Marisella, Giovanna
   - Has siblings: Paolo, Miriam, Emilia

4. **Giggino**:
   - Male
   - Has child: Felice

### Negative Examples:
1. **Giovanna**:
   - Female
   - Has parent: Mauro
   - Has sibling: Marisella

2. **Marisella**:
   - Female
   - Has parent: Mauro, Nella
   - Has sibling: Giovanna

3. **Ombretta**:
   - Female
   - Has parent: Maria, Dino
   - Has sibling: Luigi, Serena

4. **Serena**:
   - Female
   - Has parent: Maria, Dino
   - Has sibling: Luigi, Ombretta

5. **Valentina**:
   - Female
   - Has parent: Francesco, Rosanna
   - Has sibling: Antonella, Milly

6. **Luca**:
   - Male
   - Has parent: Luciano, Lucrezia

7. **Luigi**:
   - Male
   - Has parent: Maria, Dino
   - Has sibling: Ombretta, Serena

8. **Maria**:
   - Female
   - Has children: Serena, Ombretta, Luigi
   - Has sibling: Rosanna

9. **Nella**:
   - Female
   - Has children: Giovanna, Marisella
   - Has sibling: Dino
   - Has parent: NonnaLina, NonnoLuigi

10. **Miriam**:
    - Female
    - Has siblings: Paolo, Mauro, Emilia

11. **NonnaLina**:
    - Female
    - Has children: Dino, Nella

12. **Carmela**:
    - Female
    - Has children: Francesco, Giuseppe

### Analysis:
- All positive examples are **Male**.
- All positive examples have at least one **hasChild** relationship.
- The negative examples include both males and females, but none of the males in the negative examples have a **hasChild** relationship.

### Complex Class Expression:
Based on the analysis, the complex class expression that applies to the positive examples but not to the negative examples is:

\[ \text{Male} \, \text{and} \, (\text{hasChild} \, \text{some} \, \text{Thing}) \]

This expression captures the fact that the positive examples are all males who have at least one child, which distinguishes them from the negative examples.
