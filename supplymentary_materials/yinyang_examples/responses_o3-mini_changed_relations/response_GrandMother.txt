Below is one acceptable answer. In our KB the three positive examples—

 • kb:NonnoLuigi  
 • kb:Isidoro  
 • kb:Gianni

—all have the same distinguishing feature: each is a male who has at least one child who in turn is a parent (that is, who has a child). In contrast, none of the negative examples has this two‐generation property. (Note that although the question’s header says “GrandMother,” the given positive examples are all male; thus the intended learned concept is that of a grandfather.) 

Using Manchester OWL syntax we can capture this by writing:
  kb:Male and (kb:hasChild some (kb:hasChild some kb:Person))

This complex class expression says “an individual is (a) male and (b) has at least one child who in turn has at least one child (of type Person).”

Thus one acceptable answer is:
  kb:Male and (kb:hasChild some (kb:hasChild some kb:Person))
