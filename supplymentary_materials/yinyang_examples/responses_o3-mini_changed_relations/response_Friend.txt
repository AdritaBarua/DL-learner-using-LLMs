We can look at the ontology and ask: “What do the individuals that should be classified as Friend have in common that the others do not?”

Let’s first list the positive examples and note one of their key asserted relationships:

 • kb:Luigi has a kb:hasSibling relation (to kb:Ombretta and kb:Serena).  
 • kb:Maria has a kb:hasSibling relation (to kb:Rosanna).  
 • kb:Dino has a kb:hasSibling relation (to kb:Nella).  
 • kb:Serena has a kb:hasSibling relation (to kb:Luigi and kb:Ombretta).  
 • kb:Ombretta has a kb:hasSibling relation (to kb:Luigi and kb:Serena).  
 • kb:Francesco has a kb:hasSibling relation (to kb:Giuseppe).  
 • kb:Anna is connected via a sibling relation (NonnoLuigi has a sibling relation with kb:Anna—and since sibling is symmetric, Anna has a sibling).

Now, let’s consider the negative examples:

 • kb:Dora does not have any kb:hasSibling relation.  
 • kb:Gianni is not asserted to have any sibling relationship.  
 • kb:Luca is not known to have any sibling either.

Thus, a natural candidate for the “Friend” concept is to require that an individual is a Person and has at least one sibling (i.e. it appears in a hasSibling assertion). In Manchester syntax this is written as follows:

  kb:Person and (kb:hasSibling some kb:Person)

This complex class expression covers all the positive examples (each has at least one sibling) and excludes the negatives (none of which have any sibling relationship asserted).

So one acceptable answer is:

 Friend ≡ kb:Person and (kb:hasSibling some kb:Person)
