Looking at the facts for the individuals provided we note that every positive‐example individual is recorded as having one or more outgoing hasChild relations while none of the negative‐example individuals is ever the subject of a hasChild relation. (Recall that in our KB the property hasChild has range Person.) For example:

• kb:Maria has hasChild links to kb:Serena, kb:Ombretta and kb:Luigi  
• kb:Nella has hasChild links to kb:Giovanna and kb:Marisella  
• kb:Rosanna has hasChild links to kb:Valentina, kb:Milly and kb:Antonella  
• kb:Dino has hasChild links to kb:Luigi and kb:Serena  
• kb:Francesco has hasChild links to kb:Valentina, kb:Milly and kb:Antonella  
• kb:NonnaLina has hasChild links to kb:Dino and kb:Nella  
• kb:NonnoLuigi has hasChild links to kb:Nella and kb:Dino  
• kb:Mauro has hasChild links to kb:Marisella and kb:Giovanna  
• kb:Carmela has hasChild links to kb:Giuseppe and kb:Francesco  
• kb:Girolamo has hasChild links to kb:Giuseppe and kb:Francesco  

In contrast, none of the negatives (for example, kb:Giovanna, kb:Marisella, kb:Ombretta, kb:Serena, kb:Valentina, kb:Luca, kb:Luigi) appears as the subject of any hasChild assertion.

Thus, a complex class expression that characterizes exactly the positives is to require that an individual (a Person) has at least one child (i.e. a hasChild relation to some Person). In Manchester syntax we can write this as:

  Person and (hasChild some Person)

This is the complex class expression for Children as determined by our KB and the given positive/negative examples.
