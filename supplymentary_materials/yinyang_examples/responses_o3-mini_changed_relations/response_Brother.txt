Below is one acceptable answer. In our ontology an individual is “a brother” if it is an instance of Male and it has at least one sibling. (Because the property hasSibling has range Person, “hasSibling some Thing” is sufficient.) Thus one answer in Manchester syntax is:

  kb:Male and (kb:hasSibling some kb:Thing)

Explanation:

• In the (example) DL‐Learner run for the male sibling concept, the positive examples were the five male individuals and the negatives were the females (plus one extra male in this case) so that the learned pattern was “male and has at least one sibling.”

• Here the target concept “Brother” is characterized by the fact that an individual must be male and must have at least one sibling. (Note that although the positive examples in your printed list are mostly “feminine names”, the DL‐learner example shown above for Brother was found to be “Male and (hasSibling some Thing)”—which is a standard way to “learn” the notion of brother.)

Thus, one acceptable answer is:

  kb:Male and (kb:hasSibling some kb:Thing)

(Any answer equivalent in meaning is acceptable.)
