To find the complex class expression for "Sister" based on the given positive and negative examples, we need to identify the properties and class memberships that apply to all the positive examples but none of the negative examples.

### Analysis:

1. **Class Membership:**
   - All positive examples are instances of the class `Female`.
   - Negative examples include instances of `Male` and `Female`.

2. **Properties:**
   - The positive examples have relationships with `hasSibling`:
     - Antonella, Giovanna, Maria, Marisella, Milly, Miriam, Nella, Ombretta, Rosanna, Serena, and Valentina all have siblings.
   - The negative examples also have relationships with `hasSibling`, but they are not all `Female`.

### Complex Class Expression:

Given the analysis, the complex class expression for "Sister" should capture the fact that the individuals are `Female` and have a `hasSibling` relationship. Therefore, the complex class expression for "Sister" is:

```plaintext
Female and (hasSibling some Thing)
```

This expression indicates that a "Sister" is a `Female` who has at least one sibling, which matches the characteristics of the positive examples and excludes the negative examples based on their gender.
