To determine the complex class expression for "Father" based on the given positive and negative examples, we need to identify the properties and class memberships that apply to all the positive examples but none of the negative examples.

### Positive Examples:
- **kb:Dino**
  - Male
  - hasChild: Luigi, Ombretta, Serena
- **kb:Francesco**
  - Male
  - hasChild: Antonella, Valentina, Milly
- **kb:Mauro**
  - Male
  - hasChild: Marisella, Giovanna
- **kb:Giggino**
  - Male
  - hasChild: Felice

### Negative Examples:
- **kb:Giovanna**
- **kb:Marisella**
- **kb:Ombretta**
- **kb:Serena**
- **kb:Valentina**
- **kb:Luca**
- **kb:Luigi**
- **kb:Maria**
- **kb:Nella**
- **kb:Miriam**
- **kb:NonnaLina**
- **kb:Carmela**

### Analysis:
1. **Class Membership:**
   - All positive examples are instances of the class `Male`.
   - None of the negative examples are instances of `Male`.

2. **Property Relationships:**
   - All positive examples have the `hasChild` property with at least one value of type `Person`.
   - None of the negative examples have the `hasChild` property with a value of type `Person` in the context of being a father.

### Complex Class Expression:
Based on the analysis, the complex class expression for "Father" is:

\[ \text{Male} \, \text{and} \, (\text{hasChild some Person}) \]

This expression captures the fact that a "Father" is a male who has at least one child, which is consistent with the positive examples and excludes the negative examples.
