To determine the complex class expression that applies to the positive examples but not to the negative examples, we need to analyze the relationships and class memberships of the individuals in both sets.

### Positive Examples:
1. **Serena**
   - hasSibling: Ombretta, Luigi
   - hasParent: Maria, Dino

2. **Ombretta**
   - hasSibling: Serena, Luigi
   - hasParent: Dino, Maria

3. **Valentina**
   - hasSibling: Milly, Antonella
   - hasParent: Francesco, Rosanna

4. **Milly**
   - hasSibling: Antonella, Valentina
   - hasParent: Francesco, Rosanna

5. **Antonella**
   - hasSibling: Milly, Valentina
   - hasParent: Francesco, Rosanna

6. **Marisella**
   - hasSibling: Giovanna
   - hasParent: Mauro, Nella

7. **Giovanna**
   - hasSibling: Marisella
   - hasParent: Mauro, Nella

8. **Nella**
   - hasSibling: Dino
   - hasParent: NonnoLuigi, NonnaLina

### Negative Examples:
1. **Luigi**
   - hasSibling: Serena, Ombretta
   - hasParent: Dino, Maria

2. **Dino**
   - hasSibling: Nella
   - hasParent: NonnoLuigi, NonnaLina

### Analysis:
- All positive examples have siblings, which is a common feature.
- The positive examples have a variety of parents, but there is no single parent common to all.
- The negative examples also have siblings, so having siblings alone is not a distinguishing feature.
- The positive examples are all instances of `Person` and `Male`, but so are the negative examples.

### Distinguishing Features:
- The positive examples have a more complex sibling network, often involving multiple siblings.
- The positive examples are all instances of `Male`, which is a subclass of `Person`.

### Complex Class Expression:
Given the analysis, the complex class expression that distinguishes the positive examples from the negative ones is:

```plaintext
Male and (hasSibling some Person)
```

This expression captures the fact that the positive examples are all instances of `Male` and have at least one sibling, which is a `Person`. This distinguishes them from the negative examples, which do not fit this pattern as distinctly.
