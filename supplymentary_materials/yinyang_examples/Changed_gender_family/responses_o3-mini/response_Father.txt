Below is one answer that a DL‐learner might return. In this ontology the “male‐typed” individuals (in the later list) actually turn out not to be the ones “acting as fathers” (that role is played by those originally asserted to be Female). In other words, the positive examples (kb:Dino, kb:Francesco, kb:Mauro, kb:Giggino) are all members of the class Female and each has at least one child. In contrast the negatives either lack any hasChild relationship or (if they are parents) are typed as Male. (This is the exact mirror of the example where “Brother” was defined as “Female and (hasSibling some Thing)”.)

A complex class expression obtained by DL‐Learner for Father based on these examples is therefore:

  Female and (hasChild some Thing)

In Manchester syntax you would write exactly that:

  Female and (hasChild some Thing)

This expression says that an individual belongs to Father if (1) it is in the class Female (that is, it is “of the parent generation” in this ontology) and (2) it has at least one child (via the hasChild property). This expression correctly includes kb:Dino, kb:Francesco, kb:Mauro and kb:Giggino while excluding the negative examples.
