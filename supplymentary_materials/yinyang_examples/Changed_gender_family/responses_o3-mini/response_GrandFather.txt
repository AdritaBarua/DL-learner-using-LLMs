The DL‐Learner system typically “discovers” that a grandfather is someone who is male and who has a child that itself has a child. In Manchester syntax this is represented as:

  Male and (hasChild some (hasChild some Person))

Let’s briefly explain how this fits our examples:

• Each positive instance (kb:NonnoLuigi, kb:Isidoro, kb:Gianni) is known to be (or, by context, intended to be) male and each has at least one child who in turn has at least one child.

• For example, kb:NonnoLuigi has a child (such as kb:Nella or kb:Dino) and one of those children (for instance kb:Nella) has a child (such as kb:Giovanna or kb:Marisella).

• In contrast, none of the negative examples (kb:Giovanna, kb:Marisella, kb:Ombretta, kb:Serena, kb:Valentina, kb:Luca, kb:Luigi, kb:Dino, kb:Maria, kb:Mauro, kb:Nella, kb:Miriam, kb:NonnaLina, kb:Carmela) satisfy both conditions at the same time—either they are not male or they do not have a child that in turn has a child.

Thus, based on the knowledge base and the positive and negative examples given, a suitable complex class expression for GrandFather is:

  Male and (hasChild some (hasChild some Person))
