We can show that all three of the positive individuals play a “grand‐parent” role and are known to be explicitly Female, whereas every negative individual either is not Female or (if a parent at all) is not one whose child is also a parent. In other words, the only females in the ontology that have a child who in turn has a child are kb:NonnoLuigi, kb:Isidoro and kb:Gianni, while every other individual either does not have any child at all or – if it is a parent – its children do not have any children.

In Manchester syntax one acceptable answer is therefore:

  Female and (hasChild some (hasChild some Person))

Let’s explain briefly how this works:

• “Female” restricts the class to only those individuals explicitly or inferentially of type Female. (In our ontology some individuals listed as “Female” remain so, while several negatives have been re‐classified as Male or are only known as Person.)

• “hasChild some (hasChild some Person)” says “there is at least one child who in turn has at least one child” (that is, the individual is a grand‐parent). Checking the ontology:
  – kb:NonnoLuigi has (at least) two children (kb:Nella and kb:Dino) and at least one grandchild (e.g. kb:Nella’s child, kb:Giovanna or kb:Marisella),
  – kb:Isidoro is the parent of kb:Luciano and kb:Luciano is the parent of kb:Luca,
  – kb:Gianni is the parent of, for example, kb:Maria (and kb:Rosanna), whose child (e.g. kb:Luigi or kb:Ombretta) is present.
Meanwhile none of the negatives (even those who are parents) have a child who is in turn a parent—and when the gender assertions are taken into account, all negatives that do have descendants are not of type Female.

Thus the complex class expression that “covers” exactly the positives is:

  Female and (hasChild some (hasChild some Person))
