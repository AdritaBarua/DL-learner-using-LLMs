Below is one way to “explain” the answer.

Looking at the ontology we see that the same set of individuals is given twice, once by gender. For example, notice that in the latter part of the knowledge base the following individuals are asserted as being members of kb:Male:

  kb:Giovanna, kb:Marisella, kb:Valentina, kb:Milly, kb:Antonella, kb:Serena, kb:Ombretta, kb:Nella, … 

whereas the negatives (kb:Luigi and kb:Dino) are not in that list (they appear only as kb:Female).

In our positive examples

  kb:Serena, kb:Ombretta, kb:Valentina, kb:Milly, kb:Antonella, kb:Marisella, kb:Giovanna, kb:Nella

all are asserted to be kb:Male, while the negative examples

  kb:Luigi, kb:Dino

are not.

Since no other property (for example, all positives do have at least one sibling, but so do the negatives) is able to “cut‐apart” the positives from the negatives, the simplest complex class expression (in Manchester syntax) that correctly covers the positives and excludes the negatives is just the membership in the male class.

In Manchester syntax (using the kb: prefix) the answer is therefore:

  kb:Male

This is the same kind of answer that DL‐Learner might output if it found that (when forced to “explain” the positive examples) the only common discriminating feature was that they were in kb:Male.
