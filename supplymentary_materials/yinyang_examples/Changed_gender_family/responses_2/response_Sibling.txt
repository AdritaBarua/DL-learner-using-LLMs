To find a complex class expression for "Sibling" based on the given positive and negative examples, we need to identify the properties and class memberships that are common to all positive examples but not present in any negative examples.

### Analysis:

1. **Positive Examples:**
   - **Luigi**: Has siblings (Ombretta, Serena), is a child of Dino and Maria.
   - **Maria**: Has siblings (Rosanna), is a child of Gianni and Dora.
   - **Dino**: Has siblings (Nella), is a child of NonnoLuigi and NonnaLina.
   - **Serena**: Has siblings (Luigi, Ombretta), is a child of Dino and Maria.
   - **Ombretta**: Has siblings (Luigi, Serena), is a child of Dino and Maria.
   - **Francesco**: Has siblings (Giuseppe), is a child of Girolamo and Carmela.
   - **Anna**: Has siblings (NonnoLuigi).

2. **Negative Examples:**
   - **Dora**: Has a child (Maria).
   - **Gianni**: Has a child (Maria).
   - **Luca**: Has parents (Luciano, Lucrezia).

### Common Characteristics of Positive Examples:
- All positive examples have at least one sibling relationship.
- They are all instances of the class `Person`.

### Characteristics of Negative Examples:
- None of the negative examples have a sibling relationship mentioned in the knowledge base.

### Complex Class Expression:
Based on the analysis, the complex class expression for "Sibling" should capture the fact that the individual has at least one sibling. This can be expressed as:

```plaintext
Person and (hasSibling some Thing)
```

This expression indicates that the individual is a `Person` and has at least one `hasSibling` relationship with some `Thing` (which, in this ontology, would be another `Person`). This expression applies to all positive examples and none of the negative examples, thus correctly identifying the concept of "Sibling" in this context.
