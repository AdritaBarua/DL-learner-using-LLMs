To determine the complex class expression that distinguishes the positive examples from the negative examples, we need to analyze the relationships and properties that are common among the positive examples but not present in the negative examples.

### Analysis:

1. **Class Membership**:
   - All positive examples are instances of the class `Male`.
   - Some negative examples are also instances of `Male`, so this alone is not sufficient.

2. **Relationships**:
   - Many positive examples have relationships such as `married`, `hasChild`, `hasParent`, and `hasSibling`.
   - We need to identify a pattern or a specific relationship that is common among the positive examples but not in the negative examples.

3. **Common Relationships**:
   - **Married**: Many positive examples have a `married` relationship, but this is also present in some negative examples.
   - **HasChild**: A significant number of positive examples have a `hasChild` relationship.
   - **HasParent**: This relationship is also common but not unique to the positive examples.
   - **HasSibling**: This relationship is less common among the negative examples.

4. **Unique Patterns**:
   - A potential pattern is the combination of being `Male` and having a `hasChild` relationship, which is more prevalent in the positive examples.

### Conclusion:

Based on the analysis, a complex class expression that captures the commonality among the positive examples while excluding the negative examples could be:

**Male and (hasChild some Thing)**

This expression indicates that the individual is a `Male` and has at least one child, which aligns with the characteristics of the positive examples and is less common among the negative examples.
