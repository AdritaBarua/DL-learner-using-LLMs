To determine the complex class expression that distinguishes the positive examples from the negative examples, we need to analyze the characteristics and relationships of the instances in both sets. The goal is to find a pattern or set of conditions that apply to all positive examples but not to any negative examples.

### Analysis:

1. **Class Membership:**
   - All positive examples are instances of the class `Male`.
   - Negative examples include instances of both `Male` and `Female`.

2. **Relationships:**
   - Many positive examples have relationships such as `hasChild`, `hasParent`, `hasSibling`, and `married`.
   - We need to identify a specific relationship or combination of relationships that are common among the positive examples but not present in the negative examples.

3. **Common Patterns:**
   - Positive examples often have the `hasChild` relationship.
   - Positive examples are involved in sibling relationships (`hasSibling`).
   - Positive examples are involved in parent-child relationships (`hasParent`).

4. **Exclusion of Negative Examples:**
   - Negative examples include instances with `married` relationships, which are also present in positive examples, so this cannot be used as a distinguishing factor.
   - Negative examples include instances with `hasParent` and `hasChild` relationships, so these alone cannot be used.

### Complex Class Expression:

Based on the analysis, a potential complex class expression that captures the characteristics of the positive examples while excluding the negative examples could be:

```plaintext
Male and (hasSibling some Thing) and (hasChild some Thing)
```

This expression indicates that the individual is male, has at least one sibling, and has at least one child. This combination of conditions is likely to apply to the positive examples while excluding the negative examples, given the relationships and class memberships observed in the knowledge base.
