To determine the complex class expression that distinguishes the positive examples from the negative examples, we need to analyze the relationships and properties that are common among the positive examples but not present in the negative examples. 

### Analysis:

1. **Class Membership**:
   - All positive examples are instances of the class `Female`.
   - Some negative examples are instances of `Male`.

2. **Relationships**:
   - Many positive examples have relationships like `hasSibling`, `hasParent`, or `hasChild` with other instances.
   - Some positive examples are involved in `married` relationships, but this is also true for some negative examples.

3. **Common Patterns**:
   - Positive examples often have `hasSibling` relationships.
   - Positive examples often have `hasParent` relationships with other `Female` instances.
   - Positive examples often have `hasChild` relationships with other `Female` instances.

### Complex Class Expression:

Based on the analysis, a complex class expression that captures the commonalities among the positive examples while excluding the negative examples could be:

```plaintext
Female and (hasSibling some Female) and (hasParent some Female) and (hasChild some Female)
```

This expression indicates that the instances are of the class `Female` and have relationships `hasSibling`, `hasParent`, and `hasChild` with other instances of the class `Female`. This captures the common patterns observed in the positive examples and distinguishes them from the negative examples.
