To determine the complex class expression that distinguishes the positive examples from the negative examples, we need to analyze the relationships and properties that are common among the positive examples but not present in the negative examples. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the analysis:

1. **Class Membership**: All positive examples are instances of the class 'Male'. This is a key differentiator since some of the negative examples are instances of 'Female'.

2. **Relationships**:
   - Many of the positive examples have the relationship `hasSibling` with other instances. This is a common feature among the positive examples.
   - The positive examples often have relationships like `hasParent` and `hasChild`, but these are also present in some negative examples, so they are not as distinguishing.

3. **Common Patterns**:
   - The positive examples frequently have the `hasSibling` relationship, which is less common in the negative examples.
   - The positive examples are all instances of 'Male', which is a significant differentiator.

Based on this analysis, the complex class expression that captures the commonalities among the positive examples while excluding the negative examples is:

**Male and (hasSibling some Thing)**

This expression indicates that the individual is a male and has at least one sibling, which aligns with the characteristics observed in the positive examples.
