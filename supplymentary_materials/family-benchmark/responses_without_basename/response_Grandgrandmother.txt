To determine the complex class expression that distinguishes the positive examples from the negative examples, we need to analyze the relationships and class memberships of the instances in both sets. Let's break down the characteristics of the positive examples and see how they differ from the negative examples:

### Positive Examples:
1. **ex:F2F19, ex:F2F28, ex:F2F10**: These are instances of the class 'Female' and have relationships such as 'hasSibling', 'hasChild', and 'hasParent'.
2. **ex:F3F46, ex:F3F42, ex:F3F41**: These are instances of the class 'Female' and have relationships like 'married', 'hasChild', and 'hasParent'.
3. **ex:F5F61**: An instance of 'Female' with relationships like 'married' and 'hasChild'.
4. **ex:F6F93, ex:F6F70**: Instances of 'Female' with relationships such as 'married', 'hasChild', and 'hasParent'.
5. **ex:F7F106, ex:F7F121, ex:F7F105, ex:F7F103**: Instances of 'Female' with relationships like 'hasChild', 'hasParent', and 'married'.
6. **ex:F8F133**: An instance of 'Female' with a 'married' relationship.
7. **ex:F9F141, ex:F9F140**: Instances of 'Female' with relationships like 'married', 'hasChild', and 'hasParent'.
8. **ex:F10F172**: An instance of 'Female' with relationships like 'married' and 'hasChild'.

### Negative Examples:
1. **ex:F10M196, ex:F9M149, ex:F6M73, ex:F7M102, ex:F10M176**: These are instances of the class 'Male'.
2. **ex:F10F191, ex:F2F24, ex:F8M138, ex:F2F33, ex:F2M39, ex:F6F77, ex:F1M4, ex:F10F198, ex:F9F156, ex:F10F174, ex:F5M66, ex:F2F22**: These are instances of 'Female' but have different relationship patterns compared to the positive examples.

### Analysis:
- The positive examples are all instances of the class 'Female'.
- They have a common pattern of relationships, such as being married, having children, and having siblings or parents.
- The negative examples include both 'Male' instances and 'Female' instances with different relationship patterns.

### Complex Class Expression:
Based on the analysis, the complex class expression that captures the characteristics of the positive examples but not the negative examples is:

```plaintext
Female and (hasChild some Thing) and (married some Thing)
```

This expression indicates that the instances are of the class 'Female' and have relationships where they are married and have children, which distinguishes them from the negative examples.
