To determine the complex class expression that distinguishes the positive examples from the negative examples, we need to analyze the relationships and properties that are common among the positive examples but not present in the negative examples. Based on the given ontology and examples, we can identify the following characteristics:

1. **Gender**: All positive examples are instances of the class 'Female'. This is a significant distinguishing factor since the negative examples include instances of both 'Male' and 'Female'.

2. **Relationships**: We need to identify any specific relationships that are common among the positive examples but not among the negative examples. For instance, many of the positive examples have relationships like `hasSibling`, `hasParent`, or `hasChild` with other instances, which might not be as prevalent or structured in the negative examples.

3. **Class Hierarchy**: The positive examples are all instances of subclasses of 'Person', specifically 'Female', which is a subclass of 'Person'.

Given these observations, the complex class expression that captures the commonalities among the positive examples while excluding the negative examples is:

```plaintext
Female and (hasSibling some Thing)
```

This expression indicates that the instances are of the class 'Female' and have a 'hasSibling' relationship with some instance of 'Thing'. This captures the essence of the positive examples, as they are all female and have sibling relationships, which is not a common feature among the negative examples.
