To determine the complex class expression that distinguishes the positive examples from the negative examples, we need to analyze the relationships and properties that are common among the positive examples but not present in the negative examples. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the analysis:

1. **Identify Common Characteristics in Positive Examples:**
   - Many of the positive examples are instances of the class `Female`.
   - Several positive examples have relationships such as `hasSibling`, `hasParent`, or `married` with other instances.
   - Some positive examples are involved in relationships like `hasChild`.

2. **Identify Characteristics in Negative Examples:**
   - The negative examples include instances from both `Male` and `Female` classes.
   - Some negative examples have relationships like `married`, `hasChild`, or `hasParent`, but these are not consistently present across all negative examples.

3. **Determine Distinguishing Features:**
   - A significant number of positive examples are involved in sibling relationships (`hasSibling`).
   - Many positive examples are involved in parent-child relationships (`hasParent` or `hasChild`).
   - The positive examples are predominantly from the `Female` class.

4. **Formulate the Complex Class Expression:**
   - Based on the analysis, a distinguishing feature of the positive examples is their involvement in sibling relationships and their classification as `Female`.
   - Therefore, a potential complex class expression could be:
     ```
     Female and (hasSibling some Thing)
     ```

This expression captures the essence of the positive examples being predominantly female and having sibling relationships, which is less common or absent in the negative examples.
