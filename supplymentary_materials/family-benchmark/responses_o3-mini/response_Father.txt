We can “learn” the male parents (fathers) by noticing that every positive example is a male who is known to be a parent—that is, each one is an instance of Male and is related via hasChild to at least one individual (which – by virtue of the knowledge base – is a Person). In contrast, the negatives either turn out not to be male or (if they are male) do not have any hasChild relation. (For example, ex:F10M176 is male but does not appear as having a child, and ex:F5M63 and several others that are not even Male are in the negatives.)

Thus, following the style of the sample (for Brother, “Male and (hasSibling some Thing)”), one can “learn” that a Father is exactly a male who has at least one child. In DL‐syntax this is written as:

  Male ⊓ (hasChild some Person)

In words: “Father” is the class of all individuals that are Male and that have at least one hasChild relationship to a Person.

So the complex class expression for Father (based on the given positive and negative examples) is:

  Male and (hasChild some Person)
