Below is one acceptable answer. One way to “explain” a Grandgrandfather is to require that an individual be male and have at least one child who in turn has at least one child who in turn has at least one child – that is, there is a three‐step “hasChild” chain ending in a person.

A corresponding OWL class expression (using DL syntax) is:

  Male and (hasChild some (hasChild some (hasChild some Person)))

In other words, an individual is a Grandgrandfather if and only if it is a Male and there exists some Y such that it hasChild Y, and there exists some Z such that Y hasChild Z, and there exists some W such that Z hasChild W.

This expression correctly covers the positive examples (for instance ex:F2M20, ex:F2M29, ex:F2M9, ex:F3M45, …, ex:F10M171, all of which are males with at least three “hasChild” generations) while excluding the negative examples (which fail to have the three‐generation descendant chain or are not male). 

Any DL‐learner–style method that extracts a complex class expression from the given examples would return an expression equivalent to the one above.
