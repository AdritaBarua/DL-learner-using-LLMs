Below is one acceptable answer. One way to “explain” the result is by observing that every positive example in the set is a Person who is known (by one or more explicit assertions in the KB) to have a sibling, whereas none of the negatives have any such “hasSibling” partner. (Note that the KB uses “hasSibling” for mutually related individuals.) 

Thus one complex class expression (in DL– or Manchester–style notation) that covers exactly those individuals is:

  Person and (hasSibling some Person)

In words, “a Person that has at least one sibling who is also a Person.” 

Any equivalent expression (for example, using a minimum cardinality restriction such as “Person and (hasSibling min 1 Person)”) is acceptable as a solution for PersonWithASibling.
