We can show that all the positive examples (which are all males from various families) have in common that each one is not only a Male but also has a parent who is herself a child of someone (that is, each has a grandparent). In other words, every positive example has a “hasParent” chain of length 2. In contrast, the negative examples either are not male or (if they are male) they lack a two‐generation “hasParent” chain.

A standard way in Description Logic to say that an individual has a grandparent is to require that there exists an individual y such that x hasParent y and y in turn hasParent some Person. Remember that every parent is by assumption a Person. Thus, the class of “grandchildren” among the males may be defined as those individuals that are Male and have at least one parent who in turn has at least one parent.

In Manchester OWL Syntax this is written as:

  Male and (hasParent some (hasParent some Person))

This complex class expression captures exactly those individuals that are in the positive set (they are male and “two‐generations down” through the hasParent property) and excludes those not satisfying the condition (for example, males with no recorded grandparent or individuals that are not male).

Thus, the DL‐learner’s answer (i.e. the complex class expression for Grandson) based on our knowledge base and the given examples is:

  Grandson ≡ Male ⊓ (hasParent some (hasParent some Person))
