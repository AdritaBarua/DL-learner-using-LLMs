One answer that DL‐Learner might give is a conjunction saying that the “good” examples are exactly those female persons who are not known to be married. For example, one acceptable complex class expression (in Manchester syntax) is:

  Female and not (married some Thing)

Below is a brief rationale for this answer:

• All of the positive examples (for instance F1F5, F1F7, F2F17, …, F10F201) are individuals that are declared to be Female.
• In contrast, among the negative examples some (like F10F195, F5F65, F6F74, F9F163, F7F126, F10F185, F3F46) are actually females who are in a “married” relationship (while the other negatives are male).
• In consequence the only property that “cuts‐across” all the positives is that they are female and they do not participate in any married relationship.
 
So one correct answer is to say that the target class is

  Female and not (married some Thing)

This is one acceptable complex class expression that “picks out” the positive examples but not the negative ones.
