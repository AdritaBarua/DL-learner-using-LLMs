One answer that has been accepted in DL‐Learner experiments is very concise. For example, one solution was:

  Male and (hasSibling some Thing)

What does this mean? It says that an individual is in the complex concept exactly when it is a Male and it has at least one sibling.

In our knowledge base the positive examples (ex:F2M13, ex:F2M18, ex:F2M25, ex:F2M23, ex:F2M21, ex:F2M32, ex:F2M35, ex:F3M44, ex:F3M51, ex:F3M47, ex:F3M45, ex:F5M68, ex:F5M66, ex:F6M75, ex:F6M73, ex:F6M81, ex:F6M90, ex:F6M99, ex:F6M100, ex:F7M112, ex:F7M110, ex:F7M113, ex:F7M117, ex:F7M115, ex:F7M125, ex:F7M123, ex:F7M131, ex:F8M138, ex:F8M136, ex:F9M147, ex:F9M151, ex:F9M155, ex:F9M153, ex:F9M161, ex:F9M159, ex:F9M166, ex:F9M162, ex:F10M183, ex:F10M184, ex:F10M190, ex:F10M188, ex:F10M199, ex:F10M197) are all males that (by virtue of sharing a parent with at least one other child) have a sibling.

In contrast, many of the negative examples (for example, ex:F4M57, ex:F1M8, ex:F2M16, ex:F2M34, ex:F10M182, etc.) either are not known to have any sibling (or at least no sibling relationship is asserted or inferred) or belong to the “only‐child” part of their family.

Thus one acceptable complex class expression (in Manchester syntax) is

  Male and (hasSibling some Thing)

Note that other equivalent or slightly more complex expressions (for example, using the “hasParent” role to “compute” the siblinghood by saying that the individual has a parent who has at least two children) are also possible. For example, one may also write

  Male and (hasParent some (hasChild min 2 Thing))

which is equivalent (under the usual assumptions that hasSibling is defined via common parents) to the simpler expression. 

Any answer of the general form “Male and …” that picks out exactly those individuals that occur as positive examples (and not the negatives) is acceptable.
