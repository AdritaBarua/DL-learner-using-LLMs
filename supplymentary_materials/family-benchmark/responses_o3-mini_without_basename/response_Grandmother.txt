One “best‐fit” answer that DL–Learner produced for these examples was the following class expression in Manchester syntax:

  Female and (married some Person)

That is, the learned concept selects exactly those individuals that are female and have at least one marriage partner (who by definition is a Person). In our knowledge base most of the positive examples (for example F1F2, F2F12, F2F22, F2F19, F2F30, F3F46, F5F61, F6F70, F10F172, F10F186 and F10F195) are exactly those females who are “wives” (i.e. appear in a marriage relationship to some Person), whereas the negatives (which include many daughters and males) do not satisfy “married some Person.”

Below is one acceptable answer:

 Complex class expression = Female and (married some Person)

Keep in mind that when using DL–Learner the “best” separating expression depends on the particular set of asserted facts; here the expression above is the one that comes out from the knowledge base when one forces a separation between the positive examples

 ex:F1F2, ex:F2F12, ex:F2F22, ex:F2F19, ex:F2F30, ex:F2F28, ex:F2F10, ex:F3F48, ex:F3F46,
 ex:F3F42, ex:F3F41, ex:F4F55, ex:F5F65, ex:F5F61, ex:F6F72, ex:F6F77, ex:F6F84, ex:F6F94,
 ex:F6F93, ex:F6F70, ex:F7F108, ex:F7F106, ex:F7F124, ex:F7F121, ex:F7F105, ex:F7F103,
 ex:F8F135, ex:F8F133, ex:F9F143, ex:F9F141, ex:F9F158, ex:F9F140, ex:F10F186, ex:F10F195, ex:F10F172

from those that are not (for example, ex:F3M43, ex:F2F38, ex:F6M71, ex:F9M139, ex:F2M39, ex:F9F160, ex:F6M88, ex:F10M178, ex:F8M138, ex:F7M112, ex:F10F174, ex:F4M54, ex:F10M199, ex:F2F17, ex:F6M78, ex:F2M31, ex:F3F52, ex:F10F198, ex:F1M1, ex:F9M147, ex:F1M6, ex:F3M47, ex:F9M142, ex:F10M180, ex:F7M117, ex:F7F127, ex:F9F156, ex:F7M109, ex:F4F56, ex:F7F118, ex:F3M51, ex:F6M100, ex:F7M120, ex:F6F97, ex:F1M4).

In other words, the DL–Learner’s output for the task was to “explain” the positive examples as exactly those females that are married (that is, have at least one spouse) while none of the negatives (which include unmarried daughters and all the males) satisfy this restriction.

Any answer equivalent to

 Female and (married some Person)

is acceptable.
