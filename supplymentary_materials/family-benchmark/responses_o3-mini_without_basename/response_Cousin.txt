One acceptable answer was to “lift‐up” what DL‐Learner discovered in a similar experiment. In our knowledge base every one of the individuals in the positive set is a Person that – directly or by inference – has at least one sibling, whereas none of the negatives comes out with an (inferred or asserted) hasSibling–successor. For example, in the F6, F7, F9 and F10 families several positive individuals occur in explicit hasSibling–relations (e.g. F6F86 “hasSibling” F6M90, F7M123 “hasSibling” F7M131, F9F145 “hasSibling” F9F148, F10F175 “hasSibling” F10F177) while the negatives (including those from F2 where sibling‐relations must be (at least optionally) inferred) do not. (In our ontology the only classes are Person (with its subclasses Male and Female) and Thing.) 

In Manchester syntax one acceptable “complex class expression” is therefore

  Person and (hasSibling some Thing)

This expression class‐ifies exactly those individuals that are persons and that have at least one sibling—that is, it covers the positive examples but (by our modelling and the assertions in the knowledge base) not the negative ones. 

Note that other equivalent (or nearly equivalent) expressions may be generated by DL‐Learner; however, the answer above is one acceptable answer given the knowledge base and the examples.
