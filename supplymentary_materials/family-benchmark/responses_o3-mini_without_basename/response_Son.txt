One answer that DL‐Learner might return is an expression roughly equivalent to:

  Male ⊓ (hasSibling some Male)

In other words, the system “learns” that the individuals to be classified positively are exactly those males who have at least one male sibling, and this property does not hold for (the few) male individuals in the negative set (nor does it hold for the females). 

Below is some explanation of how one might arrive at such an expression given the knowledge base:

1. All the positive examples are instances whose names end in “M…” and are explicitly typed as Male. (Recall that in our ontology Male is a subclass of Person.)  
2. In each “family group” (for example, the F2 group, the F3 group, …, F10 group) the positive individuals occur together – that is, they share familial relationships that (when “hasSibling” is computed from the shared parent) imply that each positive individual has at least one sibling that is also male.  
3. In many of the negative cases the Male individual (if there is one) does not belong to a multi‐member sibling group (or does not have the same “hasSibling” relationship asserted).  

Thus, one possible complex class expression that covers all the positive examples (and none of the negatives) is

  Male and (hasSibling some Male)

This is the answer we give.
