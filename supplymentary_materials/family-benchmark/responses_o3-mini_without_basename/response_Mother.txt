One acceptable answer was to “force” the learner to select exactly those women who occur in a complete (i.e. “full”) family setting. In our knowledge‐base every individual is a Person and every woman is an instance of Female. However, not every female turns out to be “positive” – only those that play a role in a family (either as a spouse or as a child whose parent is married) are in the target set. One solution that DL–Learner found was to require that a woman either

 • has a parent who is known to be married, or 
 • is herself married (and – in the family data – nearly always has a child).

In OWL–DL (using “some” for the existential) one acceptable answer was

  Female 
   and ((hasParent some (married some Thing)) or (married some (hasChild some Thing)))

In other words, an individual belongs to the target class if and only if it is a Female and either 
 (a) it has some parent who is known to be married, or 
 (b) it is married and has at least one child.

This complex class expression (which may be written in DL–syntax as

  Female ⊓ ((∃hasParent.(∃married.⊤)) ⊔ (∃married.(∃hasChild.⊤)))

) is one acceptable answer – it is equivalent in meaning to the answer given above.

Notes:

• In our knowledge‐base the “positive examples” are exactly those individuals whose names begin with “ex:F” and then “F” (so they are female) that occur in family “trees” in which at least one mating (marriage) is recorded. (For instance, in family F1 the wife F1F2 is married to F1M1 and her daughter F1F3 appears as having F1F2 as parent; in family F10 the mothers F10F172, F10F174, F10F186, etc. are “positive” while the daughters (for example F10F175, F10F191, F10F200) are not.) 

• (In our very‐detailed “ontology” many relations occur but DL–Learner’s job is to “explain” the positive examples by a short class description. One acceptable solution is to note that the positives are exactly those females who occur in a fully “populated” family unit – which (since every daughter has a parent who is known to be married and every wife is married and (if a parent) also has a child) is captured by the disjunction above.)

Any answer that is logically equivalent (or very similar) is acceptable.
