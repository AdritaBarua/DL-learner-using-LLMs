To determine the complex class expression for "PersonWithASibling" based on the given positive and negative examples, we need to analyze the relationships and properties that are common among the positive examples but not present in the negative examples.

### Analysis:

1. **Common Characteristics in Positive Examples:**
   - Many of the positive examples have relationships indicating they have siblings. For instance, `ex:F9F145` has a sibling relationship with `ex:F9F148`, and `ex:F9M151` has a sibling relationship with `ex:F9M153`.
   - The positive examples include both males and females, indicating that the class expression should not be gender-specific.
   - The positive examples are instances of the class `Person`.

2. **Common Characteristics in Negative Examples:**
   - The negative examples often lack sibling relationships or have other types of relationships such as parent-child or marriage.
   - Some negative examples are involved in relationships that are not sibling-related, such as `ex:F10M180` being married to `ex:F10F179`.

3. **Complex Class Expression:**
   - The goal is to find a class expression that captures the essence of having a sibling. This can be expressed using the `hasSibling` property.
   - Since the positive examples include both males and females, the class expression should apply to any `Person` with a sibling.

### Complex Class Expression:

Based on the analysis, the complex class expression for "PersonWithASibling" can be formulated as:

```plaintext
Person and (hasSibling some Person)
```

This expression indicates that the individual is a `Person` and has at least one sibling who is also a `Person`. This captures the commonality among the positive examples while excluding the negative examples that do not have sibling relationships.
