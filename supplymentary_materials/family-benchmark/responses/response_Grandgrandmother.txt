To determine the complex class expression for "Grandgrandmother" based on the given positive and negative examples, we need to analyze the relationships and properties that are common among the positive examples but not present in the negative examples. 

### Analysis:

1. **Positive Examples:**
   - All instances are of class `Female`.
   - Many have relationships indicating they are parents or have children, suggesting a generational role.
   - Some have relationships indicating they are married, which might be relevant for family roles.

2. **Negative Examples:**
   - Include both `Male` and `Female` instances.
   - Some are involved in relationships that do not necessarily indicate a generational role (e.g., `hasSibling`, `married`).

### Common Characteristics in Positive Examples:
- **Class:** All positive examples are instances of `Female`.
- **Relationships:**
  - Many have `hasChild` relationships, indicating a parental role.
  - Some have `hasParent` relationships, indicating they are part of a lineage.

```plaintext
Female and (hasChild some (hasChild some Thing))
```

### Explanation:
- **`Female`:** Restricts the class to female individuals.
- **`hasChild some (hasChild some Thing)`:** This expression captures the idea of being a grandmother by having a child who also has a child, thus indicating a generational role that fits the concept of a "Grandgrandmother."

This expression captures the essence of the positive examples while excluding the negative examples, as it focuses on the generational aspect of having children who themselves have children, a key characteristic of a "Grandgrandmother."
