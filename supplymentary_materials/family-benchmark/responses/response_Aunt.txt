To determine the complex class expression for "Aunt" based on the given positive and negative examples, we need to analyze the relationships and properties that are common among the positive examples but not present in the negative examples. 

### Analysis:

1. **Positive Examples:**
   - Most of the positive examples are instances of the class `Female`.
   - Many of the positive examples have relationships indicating they have siblings or are married, which could imply a family relationship.
   - Some positive examples have relationships indicating they have children, which could be relevant for defining an "Aunt" as someone who has siblings with children.

2. **Negative Examples:**
   - The negative examples include instances of both `Male` and `Female`, but they do not consistently have the same family relationships as the positive examples.
   - Some negative examples are instances of `Male`, which would not be relevant for the class "Aunt" since an aunt is typically female.

### Complex Class Expression:

Based on the analysis, a potential complex class expression for "Aunt" could be:

```plaintext
Female and (hasSibling some (hasChild some Thing))
```

### Explanation:

- **`Female`:** The class expression starts with `Female` because an aunt is typically a female relative.
- **`hasSibling some (hasChild some Thing)`:** This part of the expression captures the idea that an aunt is someone who has a sibling, and that sibling has a child. This aligns with the typical definition of an aunt as a sister of a parent.

This expression captures the essence of what it means to be an aunt in the context of the given ontology and examples. It distinguishes the positive examples from the negative ones by focusing on the gender and family relationships that are characteristic of an aunt.
