To determine the complex class expression for "Brother" based on the given positive and negative examples, we need to analyze the relationships and properties that are common among the positive examples but not present in the negative examples. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Identify Common Characteristics:**
   - All positive examples are instances of the class `Male`.
   - Many of the positive examples have a `hasSibling` relationship with another instance.
   - Some positive examples have a `hasParent` relationship, indicating a family structure.

2. **Exclude Negative Examples:**
   - The negative examples include instances that are not `Male` or do not have a `hasSibling` relationship.
   - Some negative examples are `Female`, which should be excluded from the "Brother" class.

3. **Construct the Class Expression:**
   - The class expression should capture the essence of being a "Brother," which typically involves being male and having siblings.
   - Based on the ontology and the relationships, a suitable class expression would be:

   ```plaintext
   Male and (hasSibling some Thing)
   ```

This expression indicates that an individual is a "Brother" if they are male and have at least one sibling. This aligns with the common characteristics found in the positive examples and excludes the negative examples effectively.
