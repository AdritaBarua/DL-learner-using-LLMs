To determine the complex class expression for "Uncle" based on the given positive and negative examples, we need to analyze the relationships and properties that are common among the positive examples but not present in the negative examples. 

### Analysis:

1. **Positive Examples:**
   - All positive examples are instances of the class `Male`.
   - Many of the positive examples have relationships indicating they have siblings who have children, which is a key characteristic of an "Uncle."

2. **Negative Examples:**
   - The negative examples include instances that are not necessarily male or do not have the sibling relationships that lead to having nieces or nephews.

### Common Characteristics in Positive Examples:

- **Male:** All positive examples are instances of the class `Male`.
- **Has Sibling:** Many positive examples have a sibling relationship.
- **Sibling Has Child:** The sibling of the positive examples often has a child, making the individual an uncle to that child.

### Complex Class Expression:

Based on the analysis, the complex class expression for "Uncle" can be constructed as follows:

```plaintext
Male and (hasSibling some (hasChild some Person))
```

### Explanation:

- **Male:** The individual must be male.
- **hasSibling some (hasChild some Person):** The individual must have a sibling, and that sibling must have a child. This captures the essence of being an uncle, as an uncle is typically a male sibling of a parent.

This expression captures the necessary conditions for an individual to be considered an "Uncle" in the context of the given ontology and examples.
