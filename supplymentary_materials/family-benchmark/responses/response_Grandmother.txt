To determine the complex class expression for "Grandmother" based on the given positive and negative examples, we need to analyze the relationships and properties that are common among the positive examples and absent in the negative examples. The goal is to identify a pattern or set of conditions that uniquely apply to the positive examples.

### Analysis:

1. **Class Membership**:
   - All positive examples are instances of the class `Female`.
   - Negative examples include both `Male` and `Female`.

2. **Relationships**:
   - Positive examples have relationships indicating they are parents of other individuals, specifically through the `hasChild` relationship.
   - Negative examples include individuals who are not necessarily parents or are not female.

3. **Generational Aspect**:
   - The concept of "Grandmother" implies a generational relationship, where the individual is a parent of a parent (i.e., has a child who also has a child).

4. **Common Patterns in Positive Examples**:
   - Many positive examples have a `hasChild` relationship with individuals who themselves have a `hasChild` relationship, indicating a second generational link.

5. **Absence in Negative Examples**:
   - Negative examples either lack the `hasChild` relationship or do not have children who themselves have children.

### Complex Class Expression:

Based on the analysis, the complex class expression for "Grandmother" can be constructed as follows:

```plaintext
Female and (hasChild some (hasChild some Thing))
```

### Explanation:

- **`Female`**: Ensures the individual is female.
- **`hasChild some (hasChild some Thing)`**: Indicates that the individual has a child who also has a child, capturing the generational aspect of being a grandmother.

This expression captures the essence of a "Grandmother" by ensuring the individual is female and has a child who is also a parent, which aligns with the positive examples and excludes the negative ones.
