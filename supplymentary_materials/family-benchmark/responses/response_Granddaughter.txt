To determine the complex class expression for "Granddaughter" based on the given positive and negative examples, we need to analyze the relationships and properties that are common among the positive examples but not present in the negative examples. 

### Analysis:

1. **Positive Examples:**
   - All instances are of class `Female`.
   - Many have relationships indicating they are children of other individuals, suggesting a generational relationship.
   - Some have sibling relationships, but this is not unique to the positive examples.

2. **Negative Examples:**
   - Include both `Male` and `Female` instances.
   - Some have parent or child relationships, but these do not consistently indicate a grandparent-grandchild relationship.

### Common Characteristics in Positive Examples:
- **Class:** All positive examples are instances of the class `Female`.
- **Generational Relationship:** Many positive examples have a `hasParent` relationship, and their parents also have a `hasParent` relationship, indicating a grandparent-grandchild relationship.
- **Sibling Relationships:** While present, they are not unique to the positive examples.

### Complex Class Expression:
To capture the essence of "Granddaughter," we need to express that the individual is a `Female` and has a parent who also has a parent (i.e., a grandparent). This can be expressed in OWL as:

```plaintext
Female and (hasParent some (hasParent some Thing))
```

This expression indicates that the individual is a `Female` and has a parent who, in turn, has a parent, thus capturing the generational aspect of being a granddaughter.
