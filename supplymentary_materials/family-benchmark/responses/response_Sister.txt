To determine the complex class expression for "Sister" based on the given positive and negative examples, we need to analyze the relationships and class memberships in the ontology. The goal is to identify a pattern or set of conditions that apply to the positive examples but not to the negative examples.

### Analysis:

1. **Class Membership:**
   - All positive examples are instances of the class `Female`.
   - Negative examples include instances of both `Male` and `Female`.

2. **Relationships:**
   - Positive examples often have relationships like `hasSibling`, `hasParent`, and `married`.
   - Negative examples include individuals with various relationships, but they are not consistently related to the positive examples.

3. **Common Patterns:**
   - Positive examples are all `Female` and have at least one `hasSibling` relationship.
   - Negative examples include `Male` instances and `Female` instances without a consistent sibling relationship.

### Complex Class Expression:

Based on the analysis, the complex class expression for "Sister" can be defined as:

```plaintext
Female and (hasSibling some Thing)
```

This expression captures the essence of being a "Sister" in this ontology: being a `Female` and having at least one sibling. This pattern applies to the positive examples and not to the negative examples, which include males and females without a consistent sibling relationship.
