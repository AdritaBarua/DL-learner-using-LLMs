To find the complex class expression, we need to identify the properties and class memberships that apply to the positive examples but not to the negative examples.

### Positive Examples:
- **west6**: 
  - hasCar: car_61, car_62
  - car_61: ClosedCar, LongCar, Car, loadCount three, wheels two, load circle, hasShape rectangle
  - car_62: ShortCar, Car, OpenCar, loadCount one, wheels two, load triangle, hasShape rectangle

- **west8**:
  - hasCar: car_81, car_82
  - car_81: ClosedCar, LongCar, Car, loadCount one, wheels three, load rectangle, hasShape rectangle
  - car_82: ShortCar, Car, OpenCar, loadCount one, wheels two, load circle, hasShape u_shaped

- **west10**:
  - hasCar: car_101, car_102
  - car_101: ShortCar, Car, OpenCar, loadCount one, wheels two, load rectangle, hasShape u_shaped
  - car_102: LongCar, Car, OpenCar, loadCount two, wheels two, load rectangle, hasShape rectangle

### Negative Examples:
- **west7**:
  - hasCar: car_71, car_72, car_73
  - car_71: DoubleCar, ShortCar, Car, OpenCar, loadCount one, wheels two, load circle, hasShape rectangle
  - car_72: ShortCar, Car, OpenCar, loadCount one, wheels two, load triangle, hasShape u_shaped
  - car_73: JaggedCar, LongCar, Car, loadCount zero, wheels two, loadCount zero, hasShape rectangle

- **west9**:
  - hasCar: car_91, car_92, car_93, car_94
  - car_91: ShortCar, Car, OpenCar, loadCount one, wheels two, load circle, hasShape u_shaped
  - car_92: JaggedCar, LongCar, Car, loadCount one, wheels two, load rectangle, hasShape rectangle
  - car_93: ShortCar, Car, OpenCar, loadCount one, wheels two, load rectangle, hasShape rectangle
  - car_94: ShortCar, Car, OpenCar, loadCount one, wheels two, load circle, hasShape u_shaped

### Analysis:
- **Common Properties in Positive Examples:**
  - All positive examples have cars with the `ClosedCar` class (car_61, car_81).
  - All positive examples have cars with the `LongCar` class (car_61, car_81, car_102).
  - All positive examples have cars with the `OpenCar` class (car_62, car_82, car_101, car_102).

- **Properties Not in Negative Examples:**
  - The `ClosedCar` class is not present in any of the negative examples.
  - The `LongCar` class is present in negative examples but not in combination with `ClosedCar`.

### Conclusion:
The complex class expression that applies to the positive examples but not to the negative examples is:

**hasCar some (ClosedCar and LongCar)**
