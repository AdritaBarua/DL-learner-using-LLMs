To find the complex class expression for the given positive and negative examples, we need to identify the properties and class memberships that apply to the positive examples but not to the negative examples.

### Positive Examples:
- **kb:east4** has the following relationships:
  - `hasCar` with `car_42` (DoubleCar, OpenCar, ShortCar)
  - `hasCar` with `car_41` (OpenCar, ShortCar)
  - `hasCar` with `car_44` (OpenCar, ShortCar)
  - `hasCar` with `car_43` (ClosedCar, ShortCar)

- **kb:east5** has the following relationships:
  - `hasCar` with `car_52` (ClosedCar, ShortCar)
  - `hasCar` with `car_53` (ClosedCar, ShortCar)
  - `hasCar` with `car_51` (DoubleCar, ShortCar)

### Negative Examples:
- **kb:east1** has the following relationships:
  - `hasCar` with `car_14` (OpenCar, ShortCar)
  - `hasCar` with `car_13` (OpenCar, LongCar)
  - `hasCar` with `car_12` (ClosedCar, ShortCar)
  - `hasCar` with `car_11` (OpenCar, LongCar)

- **kb:east2** has the following relationships:
  - `hasCar` with `car_21` (OpenCar, ShortCar)
  - `hasCar` with `car_22` (OpenCar, ShortCar)
  - `hasCar` with `car_23` (ClosedCar, ShortCar)

- **kb:east3** has the following relationships:
  - `hasCar` with `car_31` (OpenCar, ShortCar)
  - `hasCar` with `car_32` (ClosedCar, ShortCar)
  - `hasCar` with `car_33` (ClosedCar, LongCar)

### Analysis:
- **Common Properties in Positive Examples:**
  - Both `kb:east4` and `kb:east5` have cars that are instances of `DoubleCar` and `ClosedCar`.
  - Both have cars that are instances of `ShortCar`.

- **Properties Not in Negative Examples:**
  - The presence of `DoubleCar` is unique to the positive examples (`car_42` and `car_51`).
  - The presence of `ClosedCar` is not unique, as it appears in both positive and negative examples.

### Conclusion:
The complex class expression that applies to the positive examples but not to the negative examples is:

**hasCar some (DoubleCar and ShortCar)**

This expression captures the unique presence of `DoubleCar` in the positive examples, which is not present in the negative examples, while also being a `ShortCar`.
