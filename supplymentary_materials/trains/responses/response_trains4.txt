To find the complex class expression, we need to identify the properties and characteristics that apply to the positive examples (kb:west7 and kb:west9) but not to the negative examples (kb:west6, kb:west8, and kb:west10).

Let's analyze the given examples:

**Positive Examples:**
- **kb:west7** has the following relationships:
  - hasCar with car_73 (JaggedCar, LongCar, Car)
  - hasCar with car_71 (DoubleCar, OpenCar, ShortCar, Car)
  - hasCar with car_72 (OpenCar, ShortCar, Car)

- **kb:west9** has the following relationships:
  - hasCar with car_92 (JaggedCar, LongCar, Car)
  - hasCar with car_91 (OpenCar, ShortCar, Car)
  - hasCar with car_94 (OpenCar, ShortCar, Car)
  - hasCar with car_93 (OpenCar, ShortCar, Car)

**Negative Examples:**
- **kb:west6** has the following relationships:
  - hasCar with car_61 (ClosedCar, LongCar, Car)
  - hasCar with car_62 (OpenCar, ShortCar, Car)

- **kb:west8** has the following relationships:
  - hasCar with car_81 (ClosedCar, LongCar, Car)
  - hasCar with car_82 (OpenCar, ShortCar, Car)

- **kb:west10** has the following relationships:
  - hasCar with car_101 (OpenCar, ShortCar, Car)
  - hasCar with car_102 (LongCar, OpenCar, Car)

**Analysis:**
- Both positive examples (kb:west7 and kb:west9) have cars that are instances of JaggedCar (car_73 and car_92).
- The negative examples do not have any cars that are instances of JaggedCar.

Therefore, the complex class expression that applies to the positive examples but not to the negative examples is:

**hasCar some JaggedCar**
